Even if they never consider the question philosophically, most people have dealt with the problem emotionally. They &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt;, at a deep level, that there is something wrong here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people have attempted to offer answers. I’ve even &lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/2007/05/27/the-problem-of-evil-part-1-the-unanswered-question"&gt;taken a stab&lt;/a&gt; at it. But most of those answers are off-putting at best, and do little to advance the notion that an all-benevolent God is actually a realistic thing to believe in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And yet, here we are in this world. And year after year, we as humanity keep bringing new children into it. We do so, despite knowing that they will suffer. We do so, despite knowing that their life will consist of pain — most of which we will be powerless to prevent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Year after year, our ancestors decided that life was worth having. Generation after generation weighed the suffering and evil and goodness and joy of this world, and decided that bringing new life into it was a benevolent thing. Many of them even believed that bringing children into the world was their greatest act of love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So there is a deep irony at the heart of the Problem of Evil. To pose it as a challenge to God is also to pose it as a challenge to ourselves. To the extent that the Problem of Evil destroys our notion of God, it destroys our notion of humanity. If God isn’t benevolent, then neither are we.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if we cast in our lot with the human race, then we act in trust in the benevolence of bringing new life into the world. And so we implicitly trust in and justify God’s actions in creation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps this is the reason that most of humanity &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; believe in God. We’ve struggled with the same questions that God must struggle with, and we’ve chosen to trust in the future of humanity, in the ongoing adventure of human life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deep down, we know that to believe in God is to believe in humanity, and to believe in humanity is to believe in God.&lt;/p&gt;

Thus, the fact that it has been a while since I posted on this blog. I have been living the crazy, leave-work-and-immediately-leave-town-for-another-show-or-maybe-6 kind of lifestyle. We've had several weekends with back-to-back-to-back shows. One day, we did about 6 shows one right after another. Our tour calendar counted this as one show since it was all crammed together. That same weekend, we did three other appearances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We did a TON of work preparing for the Civic Center Show. It was a huge deal, and an immense amount of work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And we got to step up our show by a lot. People said it was the best show they'd ever seen. Period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were, however, an immense amount of technical difficulties. So even though people loved the show and said it was the most intense and best ever, I know it could have been even MORE intense. Other people don't know, but I know. I know how much more ridiculously awesome it could have been.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which just means next time, it will be mind-blowing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-micah&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/how-to-become-immortal/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/how-to-become-immortal/</link><pubDate>Fri Jan 20 00:13:35 CST 2017</pubDate><title>How to Become Immortal</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>In the last few years, a number of different organizations have launched projects to *end aging* and radically extend human longevity.

Google’s &lt;a href="https://www.calicolabs.com/"&gt;Calico Labs&lt;/a&gt; is perhaps the most well-known effort, followed by Aubrey De Grey’s &lt;a href="http://www.sens.org/"&gt;SENS foundation&lt;/a&gt;—but many others are working on the same problem under less obvious terms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If these efforts were to succeed, humanity might become biologically immortal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That statement might be a bit misleading. “Biologically immortal” doesn’t mean that humans stop dying. It simply means that there is no fixed end of human life—that medicine is able to treat things like heart disease, cancer, and dementia in a complete way. After all, if those diseases were cured, there would be no more “natural causes” for us to die from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But we would still die for other reasons. We would still have accidents, walk in front of buses, and encounter hazardous road conditions. We would stop dying like our agricultural ancestors did (from disease), and return to dying like our hunter-gatherer ancestors did (from accident).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m supportive of these efforts, which are simply continuations of our medical efforts in other areas, extending our ability to heal. I’ve even discussed this in terms of &lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/2016/02/17/why-christians-should-support-radical-life-extension"&gt;scripture and the Christian worldview&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the terminology here highlights a source of great confusion. When &lt;em&gt;biologists&lt;/em&gt; say things like “immortal” and “human”, they usually mean something very specific. When the rest of us use these terms, they mostly mean something far different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I say I want a &lt;em&gt;more human&lt;/em&gt; legal system, I’m not suggesting that we inject homo sapiens DNA into the Constitution. When I say that “their treatment was inhuman”, I’m not suggesting it was done by wolves or elephants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, I’m using “human” as a &lt;em&gt;moral&lt;/em&gt; term, to refer to our highest ideals and expressions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, when I talk in a religious context about being immortal, I’m not talking simply talking about the biological causes of cellular damage. I’m talking about a sense of indestructible permanence—a guarantee of infinite life that is manifested in how we live and work and relate to each other. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It should be obvious that no medical technology can fully deliver that. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biological immortality, after all, still leaves us exposed to death by drowning, fire, and explosion. Even if we were to somehow become impervious to those, we’d still be susceptible to all kinds of other natural disasters, from rogue asteroids to local supernovas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’d almost certainly still be susceptible to death at the hands of other humans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And even if we thought we had settled all of those concerns, &lt;em&gt;immortality&lt;/em&gt; requires a literal infinity of time. There’d simply be no way to &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; that you were immortal before infinite time had passed—you would always be at risk of encountering some new threat that could destroy you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus, from within a finite reality, there is simply no such things as a guarantee of immortality in the sense that we usually mean it. Biological immortality is one thing, &lt;em&gt;moral&lt;/em&gt; immortality is something different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But does that mean immortality is forever out of reach?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don’t think so. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In our above analysis, we missed something. We acted as if the medical technology had just appeared out of nowhere, and was administered by no one. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In reality, of course, medical technology is administered by other human beings, who care—to some real extent—whether you live or die. And in reality, medical technology is developed by other human beings, who care about the value of human life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if these projects were run by sociopaths who were only in it for themselves, they are funded and supported by other human beings for whom it actually matters. Nothing we do is alone—nothing we accomplish is without each other. Every human project, organization, or institution, is a vast cooperative enterprise, ultimately reaching out to involve the whole human race. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That doesn’t mean every project or organization is good. It means that no project or organization can exist without relying on the good of others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that points us to the real answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are alive today only by virtue of others. If we heal our diseases, it will be by virtue of others. If we cure aging, it will be by virtue of others. If we become more resilient than we ever thought possible, it will be by virtue of others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we fall down a well, we will escape by virtue of others. If our heart stops beating, we will be revived by others. If we sustain a hundred-year lifespan—or a thousand-year lifespan—it will be by virtue of others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only the benevolence of others, freely working together for the greater good, will sustain us over the centuries and millennia ahead. Only this benevolence will prevent us from dying at the hands of an asteroid or supernova. Only this benevolence will bring us back from the brink of non-existence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whatever means there are for sustaining ourselves, they will ultimately come up against some new threat or some unprecedented risk. And eventually, we will almost certainly die.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if someone or some larger community cares, they will &lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/all-are-alive"&gt;push back that definition of death&lt;/a&gt;. They will restart your heart, reboot your brain, restore your missing limbs. They will do everything they can to bring you back—and if that effort fails, they will keep you in their hearts until there’s a chance that it can succeed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, knowing that someone else cares about you, that someone else will protect you or preserve you, that someone else will fight for you and revive you—is the only guarantee that you will overcome death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The traditional notions of immortality were right. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end, the only thing that can defeat death—the only thing that can make you immortal—is &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2008/05/13/the-last-night-in-africa/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2008/05/13/the-last-night-in-africa/</link><pubDate>Tue May 13 22:28:00 CDT 2008</pubDate><title>The Last Night in Africa</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>Tonight was our greatest show so far - and to think it would be in the African desert.I got up this morning, and walked 4 miles in the blazing sun, in a place where humidity reaches 100%.

I'm not a sun person, but it was worth it. The trail led outside the military base, so I had to present identification and register to actually walk outside. They warned us about malaria, insects, and wild dogs. I wore insect repellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did run into some wild dogs. They were actually kind of cute, in a weird, spotted-like-a-cow way. I picked up two sticks, just in case. After that, I saw what someone called "Meebos", they look kind of like meerkats or squirrels, but weirder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And of course, I saw French paragliders gliding over the ocean. The trail led out to the end of the runway for the military planes, so I stood at the end of it, and looked out to the ocean. Planes flew right by us. The French were here long before Americans, so they know how to have fun here - go paragliding in the early morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the trip wouldn't have been complete without the random truck decorated like a pinata driving by and the Africans inside asking us if we spoke French.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At least, I assume that's what they asked. I don't speak French.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Afghani trucks were the same way. Our semi-trucks are all about function - theirs get decorated like crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We leave for the United Arab Emirates tomorrow. As always on this trip, we have no idea what will happen or who we will meet or where we will go when we get there. Someone knows, and they'll tell us on a need-to-know basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's kind of nice.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/03/22/walter-wink/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/03/22/walter-wink/</link><pubDate>Thu Mar 22 17:31:18 CDT 2012</pubDate><title>Walter Wink</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>Walter Wink is primarily significant to me for his work in defining the concept of *The Powers* and tying that together with Christus Victor atonement theory.

Briefly put, his idea is that the scriptural world-view is based on seeing humanity as controlled by legions of different "principalities and powers". He suggests that we take this viewpoint seriously, and explains how they were referring to the very real cultural forces that are present in everything from mobs to political institutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've written about that concept &lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/03/22/aliens-among-us"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and about the worldview in my series &lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/series/christianity-anthropology"&gt;Christianity as Anthropology&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've read his &lt;em&gt;Powers Trilogy&lt;/em&gt;, and then the more summary work "The Powers That Be".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0385487525/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=httpmicahreco-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0385487525"&gt;The Powers That Be: Theology for a New Millennium&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=httpmicahreco-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0385487525" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/entity/Walter-Wink/B001HMKEVA/?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=httpmicahreco-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957"&gt;All other books&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=httpmicahreco-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Wink"&gt;wiki&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href="http://www.walterwink.com/"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2004/12/31/here-we-go-again/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2004/12/31/here-we-go-again/</link><pubDate>Fri Dec 31 16:58:00 CST 2004</pubDate><title>Here we go again...</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>Hope everyone survived the holidays okay.

This drive is nothing at all compared to the pain of the morning commute into Nashville everyday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact, the drive just flies by. I listen to the radio, engage myself in my own thoughts, or eat McDonald's as I drive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But today I woke up. I didn't eat McDonald's, didn't listen to the radio, and didn't think. And I realized a strange and wonderful truth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Between me and Murfreesboro stretches a vast wilderness I must cross. The drive there is not so much a morning commute as it is an excursion between two remote outposts of civilization; outposts on the cusp of a vast expanse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The road itself, the buildings dotting that road, and my own thoughts had hidden this from me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But just looking at the reality as it flashed by convinced me that if I were to rise up a few hundred feet, the truth would be seen: this was nothing more than a flimsy covering laid on top of the wilderness underneath. The flimsy covering couldn't begin to actually contain the reality that stretched out away from it and beneath it for hundreds of miles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Odd things happen when you stop and observe.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/01/04/peter-rollins-and-deception-living-moment/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/01/04/peter-rollins-and-deception-living-moment/</link><pubDate>Wed Jan 04 08:49:24 CST 2012</pubDate><title>Peter Rollins and the Deception of Living in the Moment</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>Lately I've been reading [Peter Rollins](http://peterrollins.net/), and in doing so, have become very suspicious of anything that might provide a false sense of security.

We attempt to maintain the status quo to protect our own sense of stability and security. But &lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/01/01/new-years-resolve-change"&gt;life is change&lt;/a&gt;, and everything we do to hide this from ourselves is self-deception, a shrinking from reality, and an embracing of death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That does not mean that those who say they are &lt;em&gt;for change&lt;/em&gt; are in a better position. We say and believe many things about ourselves, only to contradict them in our actions. As Rollins would point out, the truth is in the material reality of what we do. And often, the very act of saying we are &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt; something, is what allows us to most effectively hide from it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is in this regard that I wonder about the statement "live in the moment". This is the go-to idea of many types of spirituality, the call to avoid speculations and imaginings and deal with the world as it is. While I don't have any problems with that idea as it stands, I wonder if the way in which it is interpreted and applied today isn't often an attempt to hollow out a sort of stasis within the storm of change, an assertion that here we have a core identity that lies untouched while everything is burning around us. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That sounds really nice. But the danger is that in doing so, we have created ourselves an idol, a way of ignoring the world in favor of our little cubbyhole of identity. While saying we are all for change, we are selling something which tells us that change doesn't really matter, that the things around us, and the moment we are in, are actually insignificant compared to our little "in-the-moment" world. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Really living in the moment, on the other hand, means dealing with the recognition that every moment is different, that &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; moment is not the same as the last. It does not look for stasis, because stasis is not to be found, and should be rejected even if it is was. It means, above all, that the things around us are what really deserve and demand our attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a way, living in the moment requires that we abandon our moment, in order to live in the world.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/start-here/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/start-here/</link><pubDate>Tue Apr 07 23:36:38 CDT 2015</pubDate><title>Start Here</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>  Being Human

In it, Tony Stark faces the hard question of personal identity. Who is he? Who is Iron Man? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first glance, the answer would seem to revolve around his suit. Iron Man is the guy who wears the super-powered outfit — so as Tony’s anxiety escalates, he surrounds himself with more and more suits, gradually walling himself inside a fortress of armor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this is not the truth. As all of these suits are stripped away, Stark finds himself solving problems with creativity, ingenuity, and effort. In that, he finds his real identity: he is the &lt;em&gt;mechanic&lt;/em&gt;, the one who creates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This resolution isn’t the rejection of his technology, it is the recognition that the process of creation — not the artifact — is the substance of what technology and humanity is about. Instead of finding solace in the artifacts he has created, he finds solace in his ability to continue to create and transform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is also a &lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/2014/05/27/theology-lego-movie"&gt;core idea&lt;/a&gt; of the brilliant Lego Movie. For the Lego people, the essence of heroism is not about holding onto things which can make them safe, it is about learning to see the world as a platform for creativity and play and construction. The moment of enlightenment in the movie is the realization that all of life is play — that all things are constructable and may be transformed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In that direction lies freedom. In the other direction lies consumerism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to technology, our society seems to be caught in a dilemma. On the one hand, we have cheerleaders for the latest gadget, seeing technological advancement as a matter of fashion and lifestyle. Their engagement with technology is about waiting for a larger screen, a glitzier watch band, a sleeker profile. On the other hand, we have the reactionaries who fear that every new thing threatens their humanity. Their engagement with technology consists of looking for something to fear or protest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These two responses — consumerism and reactionism — are both incredibly unhealthy. Instead of seeing technology as an &lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/2015/03/13/what-technology"&gt;outgrowth of our humanity&lt;/a&gt;, they approach technology as something alien and foreign to us. As such, they cannot engage with it in any meaningful way. They are living like Tony Stark, walling themselves inside a fortress of technological artifacts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I suspect that consumerism is responsible for widespread ennui, depression, and disengagement. It is an answer which does not satisfy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But neither does reactionism. Going to the woods only satisfies if it provides the opportunity to chop our own wood, to fell our own trees, to hunt for our own food. In other words, it only satisfies if it gives us the opportunity to engage in technological work and creation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Few reactionaries make it that far. Instead, they retreat to an artificially constructed world of technological remnants from a different era. Perhaps they use books instead of ebooks, maybe they use TVs instead of computer screens. This is no different than consumerism of a different kind — the operation of fashion and lifestyle choices in a more unusual and self-deceptive way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who have truly gone to the woods — like &lt;a href="http://brickcaster.com/singularity/1/"&gt;Kevin Kelly&lt;/a&gt;, like many of the Amish — know the value of technology, and know the joy of technological creation. They do not seek to consume, they seek to produce. They do not seek lifestyle, they seek creation.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/test/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/test/</link><pubDate>Wed Feb 03 23:16:21 CST 2016</pubDate><title>Test</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>Here is a great blog post, full of wit and wisdom, text and texture, scents and sensibility.

It’s simply this: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you start pursuing something new, it’s often because you fell in love with something old. Maybe you decided to learn music because you loved Mozart, or decided to play guitar because you worshipped Jimi Hendrix, or decided to take up ballet because you saw a breath-taking, once-in-a-lifetime performance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You have this incredible sense of taste, cultivated by exposure to brilliance. And you set out to create something just as great.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this incredible sense of taste coincides with the moment you have the least amount of skill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And so, inevitably, your first attempts will &lt;em&gt;suck&lt;/em&gt;. Compared to your dream, compared to the thing that drove you into this new art, or skill, or pursuit—everything you create will be awful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only after &lt;em&gt;years&lt;/em&gt; of work will you ever rise to the level of your masters—and during that time, you will have to put up with (produce!) reams of work you find appalling. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the paradox. To become a master, you will have to become comfortable falling short of your own standards. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Almost no one does this. Instead, filled with disappointment at their first efforts, almost everyone abandons the path too soon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I call this &lt;em&gt;The Beginner’s Paradox&lt;/em&gt;, and it has probably cost us millions of works of genius.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Intelligence Paradox&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Beginner’s Paradox shows up in all kinds of places, and I suspect that self-awareness is one of the places the paradox becomes most significant. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine that you are a creature waking up to self-awareness for the first time. Suddenly, your eyes are opened, and you can see the world as it is, in all its glory and tragedy, in all its beauty and sadness. You look out into the sky, and find that you can imagine what it’s like to be &lt;em&gt;up there&lt;/em&gt;. You look out to the horizon, and imagine yourself traveling beyond it. You think about the future and the past—about a billion years from now, and a billion years before. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then you think about yourself. And you suddenly seem incredibly small, and incredibly weak, and incredibly fragile. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the dilemma of intelligence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intelligence gives you the power to contemplate the infinite, to solve unlimited problems, and learn innumerable things. As an intelligent being, there is no problem you cannot ultimately solve, or system you cannot ultimately understand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that vast capability carries with it the awareness of just how &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; there is left to do. To be intelligent is know the infinite things you will never accomplish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The thing that gives you the ability to contemplate a million worlds, and a billion lifetimes, gives you the ability to think about how you may never leave your hometown, and how quickly people may forget you. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The thing that allows you to understand the inner workings of an atom, or build a machine that can go to space, makes you aware of just how much you &lt;em&gt;don’t&lt;/em&gt; understand, and how much you will never build.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The thing that lets you contemplate the infinite, makes you feel incredibly small. The thing that gives you incredible power, makes you feel incredibly weak. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experiencing that gap—between what you are capable of, and what you have actually achieved, between what you could be and what you are—is what we call &lt;em&gt;shame&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And knowing just how much power there is, and yet feeling your own incredible weakness—is what we call &lt;em&gt;fear&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They go hand in hand. This is the Beginner’s Paradox of consciousness: from the first moments we emerge as self-aware beings, we are overtaken and consumed by shame and fear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And historically, shame and fear have been humanity’s greatest obstacles on the path to a better world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Beatitudes — We Must Fall in order to Rise&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lately I’ve been thinking a lot about the Beatitudes. These are the first sayings in Jesus’ Sermon on the Mount, one of the most influential works of literature ever written.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hypothetically, these sayings are the foundation of the Christian religion. And yet, they are so deeply paradoxical, you are hard pressed to find someone certain of what they mean, let alone certain of how to apply them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blessed are the poor in spirit…&lt;br/&gt;Blessed are those who mourn…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the one hand, they are easy to interpret as a call to the renunciation of life, as if suicide was the most holy path, or, barring that, as if you should purposely seek misery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, there’s so much like this in Jesus’ teachings, it’s a hard feeling to shake. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And yet, Jesus is constantly reminding us that he’s not an ascetic. Unlike other religious movements of the time, his disciples do not fast. He enjoys parties, and meals, and dancing. He turns water into wine. Indeed, Christianity’s core ritual is a feast. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, many religious groups, in an effort to make themselves feel okay with their own extravagance, tone down the Beatitudes into basically nothing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which is it? What are these sayings really getting at?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we look closely, we see that these sayings are not a call to trade in the pleasures of this Earth for an other-worldly paradise. In fact, they are saying something about &lt;em&gt;this world&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;our history&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blessed are the meek,&lt;br/&gt;    for they shall inherit the earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;And they are not a call to give up aspiration or ambition—quite the opposite! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;They are instead a call to &lt;em&gt;hunger and thirst&lt;/em&gt;, to suffer and struggle, to sacrifice everything on the path to making a better world. Doing that will require abandoning the old certainties, the old securities, and trading them in for a dangerous and unpredictable journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blessed are those who have been persecuted…&lt;br/&gt; … for theirs is &lt;em&gt;the kingdom of the heavens&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is this telling us?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think the Beatitudes are describing the answer to the Beginner’s Paradox—an answer that is present everywhere the paradox shows up, and that applies to every person and every area of life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To become strong, we must embrace our vulnerability.&lt;br/&gt;To become great, we must accept defeat.&lt;br/&gt;To create brilliance, we must welcome humiliation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only when we accept these things, can we persist from our first glimpse of beauty, down into the darkness of creative suffering and struggle, and out into the light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who are too secure in the old ways will not make it, those who are too tied to security will not leave. But those who desire to create good above all else, will pursue it through the darkness and the downfall and the danger, and into the brilliance on the other side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/beginners-paradox" title="#tweet-this"&gt;We must fall in order to rise.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (&amp;lt;-- click to tweet)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Science tells us that intelligence, by its very nature, &lt;a href="http://brickcaster.com/christiantranshumanist/35"&gt;can solve any problem there is to solve&lt;/a&gt;. It can fend off killer asteroids, outsmart supernovas, and manufacture food from the cosmic background radiation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has no intrinsic limits. And yet it has a lot of limits &lt;em&gt;right now&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those &lt;em&gt;right now&lt;/em&gt; limits often loom larger than anything else. Intelligent beings face their own mortality, and become obsessed with protection, building giant fortresses and walls, amassing enormous weapons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And yet those fortresses often become prisons. They get in the way of free movement, they prevent exploration and discovery, they lock you in just as much as they lock anyone out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same is often true for weapons, because although they offer protection against external threats, they shut down free and honest communication. Without communication, intelligence has given up its most potent tool for overcoming the limits of the world around it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a more familiar example, consider that once someone has found security in their career, they may be unlikely to do anything else that is truly ground-breaking. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This kind of situation is pervasive in the human species, and every time we get caught up in it, it leads to our downfall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only way out of this dead-end obsession with current limits, at the expense of future growth, is to accept your vulnerability. To be willing to suffer, to take risks and make mistakes, to accept that you may not solve all the problems &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt;, but that by pushing through humiliation and failure, you may be a part of the solution that is eventually discovered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regardless of what it is, if you are seriously pursuing something genuinely new, you have to take the lessons of the Beatitudes to heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/beginners-paradox" title="#tweet-this"&gt;We must fall in order to rise.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because that is the only path from apprenticeship to glory.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2005/10/08/murphys-loft-showcase-2/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2005/10/08/murphys-loft-showcase-2/</link><pubDate>Sat Oct 08 16:26:00 CDT 2005</pubDate><title>Murphy&amp;#039;s Loft Showcase</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>Shelley Raymond's free and fearless vocals range from a cooing whisper to a soulful, plaintiff howl.

Her lyrics tear you apart line by line, only to build you back again with verse after verse of surgically precise digs and strokes. Raymond casually combines elements of soul and folk into something she playfully refers to as "soulk music" (which, afterall, sounds better than "foul music"). Whatever she calls it, it's not your average girl-with-a-guitar fare and deserves your undivided ear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.myspace.com/shelleyraymond"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.myspace.com/shelleyraymond"&gt;http://www.myspace.com/shelleyraymond&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rob Hawkins&lt;/b&gt; is a singer/songwriter that grew up as a well-travelled Air-Force brat before the age of five from Arizona to New Hampshire. Moving eventually from Ohio to Nashville he continues to ride the crossroads of music with his emotional voice, strong musicianship, and message driven songs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Shawn A Finson (Wee the People)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wee the People are a band; although, the name Wee the People refers less to a group of band mates and more to a group consciousness. It is a tribute to “the little people” or the commoners—those whose voice is rarely heard above the incessant drone of an ever present, growing, and looming noise machine. Wee the People use song to try and break through that ugliness. Sometimes we strive for harmony and other times we resort to dissonance, paying less homage to ideas about style than to the seminal ideas, which ultimately get stylized. Wee the People feel song is a great place to be idealistic, if not romantic. We are simply happy to have a voice, albeit small. We don’t claim to speak for everyone or even to make songs that appeal to the majority. We do, however, hope that our songs speak to someone. And we hope that someone joins in the conversation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.weethepeople.us/"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.weethepeople.us/"&gt;http://www.weethepeople.us/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Seth Harper&lt;/b&gt; is basically new to the Nashville music scene. Sprouting from deep Alabama roots, Seth looks to further a sort of Renaissance for his homeland, keeping his music wide-ranging but at the same time distinctly Southern in delivery. His voice is gritty, yet pleasant, and his songs are honest, yet oddly poetic. He tends to weave tales of weary souls, beautiful women, and second chances, all the while putting on an explicitly spiritual edge. He is still looking for just the right bandmates, but until then he will walk this road all by himself.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/the-structure-of-the-biblical-story/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/the-structure-of-the-biblical-story/</link><pubDate>Fri Mar 04 14:39:31 CST 2016</pubDate><title>The Structure of the Biblical Story</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>The biblical story is rich and complex—and full of metaphor, symbolism, and beauty.

But given its length and complexity, it’s easy to throw up our hands at the prospect of understanding it all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This can lead us to accept overly simplistic accounts—accounts which make us wonder why the Bible bothers to contain so much material in the first place. If it can all be covered in a &lt;a href="http://www.chick.com/reading/tracts/0001/0001_01.asp"&gt;Chick Tract&lt;/a&gt; you pick up at a truck stop, why do we even need the scriptures?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But I think there is a reason for all the material—*and* I think that the overall structure is fairly simple to understand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, everything you need to make sense of it is right at the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Creation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genesis describes God progressively creating, naming, and cultivating the universe, leading up to a moment when God decides to create a being &lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/04/28/image-god"&gt;in his image and likeness&lt;/a&gt;—a being like God. This being is humanity, in all its diversity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;God commissions human beings to &lt;em&gt;go and do likewise&lt;/em&gt;—just as God had created new things, humans will create new things, just as God had named creation, humans will name creation, just as God had cultivated life, humans will cultivate life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Genesis tells it, God did all of his creative work, up to and including humanity, in 6 days. On the 7th day, God rested—and instead of picking back up and continuing the process of creation, God begins to guide and train humanity to do the job he had given it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The implication is clear: going forward, the work of creation will no longer be done by God alone, but will be a partnership between God and humanity. The continuing story of the universe will unfold as humans co-create with God.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If this was the entire story, it would be complete. It tells us where we came from, what our purpose is, and what our future holds: a never-ending process of creation, exploration, and relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it has dramatic implications for the rest of the universe. Whatever comes next will be a new act of creation, emerging from the relationship between humanity and God. The fate of the universe has not yet been determined, but hinges on that relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The Downfall&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, this is not where the story ends. Very quickly, &lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/03/06/why-are-humans-evil"&gt;there is a crisis&lt;/a&gt;, and human life becomes corrupted, the human commission is largely abandoned, and human society descends into violence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But God is intent on moving humanity forward, refusing to let them get stuck in a dead end. Now that humanity has “wandered off into the woods”, so to speak, God is going to make sure they keep going, across the dangerous bridge, through the scary thicket, and back out to safety. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every time humanity reaches a point where it teeters on self-destruction, or threatens to stop moving forward, God intervenes to keep things going. This is his ultimate priority: God’s plan for the future of the universe involves the human race, and if the human race doesn’t keep developing, there will be no future at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The People of God&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The crisis at the core of humanity has no easy solution. It can’t be solved by going back to a previous situation, or by choosing between different obvious options. Like the children’s &lt;a href="http://www.funnysongsforkids.com/childrens-classics/were-going-on-a-bear-hunt"&gt;bear hunt&lt;/a&gt; singalong, the only option is to go through it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is incredibly tricky, and so God selects a group of people to embark on a mission. This people will act as a microcosm of humanity, and this mission will attempt to resolve the problem at the heart of humanity, and reboot the human race. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They will have to undergo dangerous experiments and adventures to do so. If they are successful, their efforts will spread out from them to the world, reigniting all of humanity, and relaunching the original story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The Chosen One&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over and over, these experiments fail. Different options are tested, tried, and found wanting. Finally, it seems as if everyone has given up. The people of God have succumbed to defeat, and accepted the inevitability of the world continuing as it is. They’ve lost their way, and forgotten who they are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the brink of permanent failure, a new hero steps forward from among the people. This hero looks at all of the options that have been tried, and rejects them. And then he grasps an option no one else had noticed before—a choice so scary no one else would dare try it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That choice involves him letting himself be killed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If he is successful, he will resolve the crisis at the heart of the human race, and reboot humanity. The story of the people of God will hinge on this moment, along with the future of humanity and the destiny of the universe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If he isn’t successful, the future of the world will go dark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He lets himself be killed. He stays in the ground for three days. And then he rises from the dead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reboot had worked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The Renewal of All Things&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results begin spreading immediately. The people of God had begun to experience the renewal of humanity, and now that the work of relaunching the human race had started, it was time to expand this people to include all nations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The people of God would help to usher in the transformation of entire nations, cultures, and societies. With a renewed humanity came a renewal of humanity’s original commission to create and cultivate life in the universe, to explore, to name and categorize creation—to be co-creators with God.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is no coincidence that when Jesus rose from the dead, it was on what they called “the 8th day”. God was done resting. The new day of creation had begun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The Structure of the Biblical Story&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I promised that the biblical story would be simple to understand, and I believe it is. I’ve described it at length only to show how the various pieces fit together, and why they have this relationship. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The structure itself is quite simple—it’s what poets call a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiastic_structure"&gt;chiastic structure&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creation&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Humanity&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People of God&lt;/strong&gt;
      &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jesus&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People of God&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(renewed)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Humanity&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(renewed)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creation&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(renewed)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, the scriptures work this out in considerable more detail than I have here. This structure is not arbitrary, nor is it merely symbolic or metaphorical. Its purpose—and the purpose of all that material—is to show us why everything comes to hinge on this one moment in history, this one person, and this one decision. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I haven’t tried to show that this understanding is &lt;em&gt;true&lt;/em&gt;, or detailed the specifics of why humanity has this role, what the crisis of humanity is, why a &lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/03/12/ancient-israel-vs-blood-gods"&gt;people of God&lt;/a&gt; is necessary, or how &lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/04/02/jesus-insurgent"&gt;Jesus is able&lt;/a&gt; to resolve the ultimate issue. I’ve only suggested that if you accept the Bible’s understanding of these things, this is how it plays out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is why something so seemingly inconsequential as a first-century crucifixion can be said to have universal significance. From the biblical perspective, this is the hinge of history, the event on which it all turns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This helps us unpack a lot of the Bible’s language. Jesus is identified as the &lt;em&gt;true people of God&lt;/em&gt;, because the whole purpose of the people of God rides on him. Jesus is identified as the &lt;em&gt;true humanity&lt;/em&gt;, because the entire commission of humanity is on his shoulders. Jesus is identified as the &lt;em&gt;true creation&lt;/em&gt;, because he embodies the future of the created order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just as surely, Jesus is identified as the &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; people of God, the &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; humanity, and the &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; creation. In him, creation has once again begun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the scriptures, these aren’t primarily metaphysical claims—they’re claims about history. This is why the New Testament insists that Jesus came &lt;a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+5:6&amp;version=NIV"&gt;at just&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians+4%3A4&amp;version=NIV"&gt;the right time&lt;/a&gt;. In the New Testament’s view, the future of humanity came down to that one moment, and with it, the future of the entire universe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is also how we can understand all the (often confusing) apocalyptic and eschatological language. The Bible isn’t trying to lay out a bizarre sequence of unrelated future events—it’s giving us a set of images for an unfolding renewal of humanity and creation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Paul’s language, the resurrection is a process that begins with Jesus, &lt;a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+corinthians+15%3A20-26&amp;version=NIV"&gt;spreads out&lt;/a&gt; to his followers, and continues &lt;a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+8%3A19-21&amp;version=NIV"&gt;throughout the cosmos&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is nothing less than the continuation of the story laid out in Genesis. Humanity has once again been invited to participate with God in the ongoing work of creation.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2011/11/16/i-will-not-increase-my-productivity/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2011/11/16/i-will-not-increase-my-productivity/</link><pubDate>Wed Nov 16 14:51:27 CST 2011</pubDate><title>I will not increase my productivity</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>New resolve:

But that endeavor can easily become an obsession, and that obsession can suck your attention, and then your time, bone-dry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One way to deal with that is to try decrease the time you spend reading productivity sites. But that is a self-reinforcing addict's move. The more you try to resist productivity sites, the more you focus on the productivity you're trying to gain by doing so. And so you're driven back into their arms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I'm going to read productivity sites. And I will continue to tweak my writing setup, and where I keep my files, and how I organize all the little to-dos in my life.. But I'm not going to do so for &lt;em&gt;productivity&lt;/em&gt;. I will do so for the purposes I find along the way, and sometimes, just for the joy of tweaking. And I will give up the idea that I'm working towards some kind of optimal productivity or organization. Instead, I'll just enjoy the work, and the work of the work, and the work of the work of the work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And just like that, I'm free.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2006/12/19/snow-cd-available-just-in-time-for-christmas/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2006/12/19/snow-cd-available-just-in-time-for-christmas/</link><pubDate>Tue Dec 19 20:37:00 CST 2006</pubDate><title>SNOW CD Available Just In Time For Christmas</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>The SNOW EP was a project born of interestingness.

It began as a concert that we planned to do in December of 2004 at "the Brickhouse", a small hole-in-the-wall kind of venue in St Albans, WV. It would be a Christmas Show with all the trappings. And so we practiced, and we came up with all the Christmas Carols we could sing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then we attempted &lt;a href="http://www.myspace.com/reddingbrothers"&gt;Carol of The Bells&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For people who are not familiar with this song, it is a ridiculously complex song. That is, if you're trying to sing it with only three guys. But we were determined to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that attempt led us to break down the song to its essential elements. The elements of intensity and passion and power, and...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...yippee-i-oh, yippee-i-oh-ay?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, even that one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a bold move, but one we were determined to make. And so we came up with our time-pattern-changing, genre-crossing, old-west-cowboy-rock-Christmas version of this song.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the Brickhouse concert was delayed for a couple of months, and the genius of our song would not be revealed for another year. Instead, the next Brickhouse show was the record-breaking, history-setting, all-time favorite REDDING BROTHERS BRICKHOUSE show of March of 2005. Carol of The Bells would have to wait.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But only until the next Christmas. And in Christmas of 2005, the show was set to happen in the Teays Valley Cinemas theater of Scott Depot, WV.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was the first concert of its kind; no one had played a show in the &lt;span style="font-style:italic;"&gt;theater&lt;/span&gt; before. And so we decided that we needed to have a commemorative CD, an EP that would serve for all time to mark the point that a band first held a concert in the Teays Valley Theater.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And so SNOW was born. It contained "Carol of The Bells", "Angels We Have Heard on High", our own original "Lord of Winter", the feel-good "Summer Girl Snow", and a haunting piano piece named "Winter in F#m".&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Lord of Winter" is an interesting track; an example of a song that dips deep into the well of the movie "It's a Wonderful Life" for a introspective take on the season. But that's another story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-micah&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;PS. Just in case you hadn't heard, there's one last chance for you to get the &lt;a href="http://www.reddingbrothers.com/snow"&gt;SNOW Christmas EP &lt;/a&gt;right before Christmas.

Go and watch it now, and then come back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've been engaging with a few people about it, and there seems to be several different kinds of responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On one end, there are some traditionalists who find it really offensive. Or at best, misguided, and likely to lead people astray. They will probably ignore it, or post a biting comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But then there are the evangelicals, who find it captures the way they want to feel about Jesus. They are part of a religion in all the important ways, but don't feel like "religion" really defines their experience very well. So they like it and promote it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The biggest category are the vague Christians. They don't go to church much, or do very many "Christian" things, but they apparently maintain quite strong feelings for Jesus. This video resonates with them in a real way. They probably compose the silent majority of the country, and are sincere in all the ways that Christiany Christians aren't. They love the heck out of this video.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then there are the theology hipsters. Let's face it, these people wouldn't like the video if it agreed with every single point of their doctoral thesis. They are the ones engaging in the biggest critique, suggesting that religion is a proper human category, and that making a contrast between Jesus and religion is overly-simplistic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then there are the people like me. I'm very Christian. I have a lot of discussions with the theology hipsters. I'm surrounded by evangelicals, but live in the world of vague Christians. I run a website called "&lt;a href="http://christianityagainstreligion.com"&gt;Christianity Against Religion&lt;/a&gt;".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And I'm kind of thinking that the video didn't go far enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What do you think?&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2007/08/30/the-land-of-canadia/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2007/08/30/the-land-of-canadia/</link><pubDate>Thu Aug 30 14:07:00 CDT 2007</pubDate><title>The Land of Canadia</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>Just got back from my travels in Canadia.

There are a lot of things that are great about that wonderful land, including the metric system, degrees in Celcius, bilingual everything, Tim Horton's, the Maple Leaf flag (which looks cooler than ours, I have to say), the name of the country ("Dominion of Canada" sounds a lot cooler than "US of A", you gotta admit), and so on. In addition, they can call themselves "Americans" just fine, which puts us USA-ians in the position of finding a new name for ourselves. If you're from the US, they say you're from "the States"; so maybe we ought to start saying they're from "the Provinces". Then, we could be "States-ians", and they could be "Provincials"...which, while giving us a dumb name, at least gives them an insulting one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Canadians really like combos. You know, we get a Biggie Combo, or something like that, which basically involves a sandwich, a drink, and some fries. But when we went to order pizza in Canada, the combo was Pizza, Fries, a Pop, and a Candybar. When we went to order a salad, it came with soda. When you try to buy furniture, it comes with a free TV. Canadians really like the idea of combos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are some bad things about Canadia, however. When we tried to cross the border, we discovered that pepper-spray is illegal in Canada. It's a bad as carrying a gun. We discovered this because we had to have our car searched, and travel across the border 3 times, being harassed at each step, because we dared to accidentally bring pepper-spray onto international land. When I was coming back into the US to try to find a trash can where I could dispose of this illegal substance without coming to bodily harm, the US Customs official sharply reprimanded me, then asked to see the offending substance. As I lifted it up to show him, he barked, "Put it down! Put it down!" as if I were waving a loaded gun in his face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, we disposed of this illegal pepper-spray somewhere in Detroit's 8-Mile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was only later that I discovered the truth. While it is completely ILLEGAL to carry around pepper-spray intended for use on humans, if that same pepper-spray had a label that said "BEAR SPRAY" on the front, it becomes completely LEGAL to carry and possess. And if you happen to be accosted by a human criminal, you are free to use "BEAR SPRAY" on him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So you can bet that next time I go to Canadia, I am carrying a big bottle of BEAR SPRAY.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/03/15/flip/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/03/15/flip/</link><pubDate>Thu Mar 15 08:04:51 CDT 2012</pubDate><title>The Flip</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>When you flip a coin, it's customary to ask the other person, "heads or tails?"

It could just as easily have been assigned to you by someone else. But what it &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; do, is establish &lt;em&gt;buy-in&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the moment you call "tails", you've bound yourself to abide by the result of the flip. And that's really the point - nobody cares whether you're heads or tails, they just care that you agree to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That seems to me to be kind of an intriguing little insight, a glimpse into the way the human mind has arranged its little rituals and social games. We could probably find parallels everywhere. But the most obvious one to me is the democratic process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The democratic process is an interesting little game, where we are given the choice between two ostensibly different candidates. But the choices are never really what we want - they are always, from our perspective, the lesser of two evils. This means that year after year, we are voting for evil politicians we do not want.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So why vote?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we vote, we establish buy-in. We convince ourselves it was our choice, and we give others the ability to blame us for the problems that arise. "If you didn't vote, don't complain" the saying goes. Or, "Don't blame me, I voted for Mickey Mouse!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When things go wrong, we blame the other party, the other side of the coin flip. Rather than address the problem, or the candidates, or the system that put this all in place, we blame it in on the other group.

I imagine there will be a lot of different impressions of the songs, but I felt like Christ Martin demonstrated himself to be someone who throws himself into his performances - even if that is sometimes awkward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is my aspiration - to reach for what is real and spontaneous and scary in a performance, even when it requires stepping out into new territory.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/02/03/wisdom/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/02/03/wisdom/</link><pubDate>Fri Feb 03 12:20:31 CST 2012</pubDate><title>Wisdom</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>I need wisdom.

I've always been a consumer of knowledge, someone who couldn't leave well enough alone, who had to tease apart the inner workings of things. That process leaves me with a huge gap - the gap between what is and what could be. And that gap requires wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I went searching for wisdom among ancient books, among the classics and the apocrypha and forgotten literature. But their wisdom can really only be seen once you've understood the experiences they were writing from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I learned from my parents and grandparents. I challenged their thinking, and tested it against my own. I debated local preachers, and hung around old people, hoping to gain some scraps of their condensed life experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'd heard the saying, "When the student is ready, the teacher will appear". So I eagerly waited. This student was ready. But the teacher never showed up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where are you teacher? Why have you forsaken me?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The internet was coming into its own, and I was stuck in the middle of nowhere, so I eagerly took to obscure discussion groups and bizarre websites and anonymous chat rooms. I was bathed in new information. I had so much to study, so much to pick apart and put back together again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But no one could provide me wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Churches have long positioned themselves as purveyors of wisdom. And if any one of them had been able to keep up with my slate of questions, I probably would have fallen under their spell. I wouldn't need answers - just the space to ask the things I wonder, and get feedback. But churches are quite busy targeting our culture's lowest common denominator, and rarely have space for the consideration of other thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's probably just as well. This whole process taught me that I couldn't look to other people for answers - or even for context. It taught me that sometimes, people are wrong, even if they are experts in their field. It showed me that sometimes I have to go with what I &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt;, even if everyone is saying something else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And hey, maybe that's wisdom after all.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2011/11/07/christianity-platform/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2011/11/07/christianity-platform/</link><pubDate>Mon Nov 07 20:40:18 CST 2011</pubDate><title>Christianity is a platform</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>Christianity is a platform, and platforms are measured by their generativity.

But any such system denies that humans can learn and grow, and Christianity is explicitly about learning and growing. In other words, Christianity was never meant to be the stopping point of human or spiritual understanding. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What then is Christianity? It is a set of realizations creating a new platform for human thought and action. It explicitly attempts to move humanity from the ancient religious way of thinking into a meta-conscious sort of self-direction. It moves from the idea of external motivation to the concept of internal motivation. It directly addresses the limitations humans face in living to their motivations, and it sets up a program for a new sort of humanity, centered not around temples or nations or races or external markers, but around this internal motivating force. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can talk about some of this new conception. It sits foundationally on the idea of hope, of a reality in which good tends to win out. It advises trust in the future, and in other humans. And it posits that love is the definitional basis of humankind. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is much more. But the point is that this understanding is a starting point, a framework for all the things to come. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the enlightenment was not the end point of science, but the starting point. It gave a framework for building a society and an understanding that would lead to scientific discovery. It got hold of the ideas of equality, individual discovery and decision-making, and reproducibility, and the scientific revolution was born. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where did these ideas come from? I would argue that they're a cross-section of the original Christian framework. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regardless, the point is the same. These ideas formed a ground for building. This was the intent of Christianity - not that we would believe we have found all the answers, but that we would have the tools and the foundation to build a new and better humanity. &lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2011/10/05/believe-or-dont-believe/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2011/10/05/believe-or-dont-believe/</link><pubDate>Wed Oct 05 00:21:58 CDT 2011</pubDate><title>Believe or Don't Believe</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>Belief in God amounts to a perception that the universe is bending towards *good*.

Good is winning out, complexity is increasing, beauty is spreading. If you accept that, then the lines of our future are converging on a reality that is increasingly compassionate, intelligent, and relational. Follow those lines long enough and you realize that the gravitational force that is curving reality towards these ends has begun to take on all the traditional attributes of God. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's no other alternative. Just as following the expansion of our universe backwards forces us to acknowledge a big bang, following the progression of our universe towards goodness forces us to acknowledge the place where all such progressions meet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can legitimately reject such a view entirely. It's possible the world is not advancing in any sense. If so - if in the end, reality is hopeless, and life is destined to futility - then indeed, there is no God. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But be assured, this is the true question on which it all hangs. No other theistic or atheistic argument matters. &lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2005/04/25/meghans-bday-party/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2005/04/25/meghans-bday-party/</link><pubDate>Mon Apr 25 20:07:00 CDT 2005</pubDate><title>Meghan&amp;#039;s BDay Party</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>On Sunday afternoon, we performed at Meghan's birthday party...AT THE HURRICANE PARK!Ok, so normally, playing outside would be great, fantastic even.BUT IT WAS SNOWING!That's right, we played outside ...</description><content:encoded>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;On Sunday afternoon, we performed at Meghan's birthday party...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AT THE HURRICANE PARK!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, so normally, playing outside would be great, fantastic even.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT IT WAS SNOWING!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's right, we played outside in the freezing cold.

Some people want to upgrade email clients to handle email as a &lt;a href="http://mail-pilot.com/"&gt;task-list&lt;/a&gt;, or make it more like &lt;a href="http://minimalmac.com/post/27915486406/on-email"&gt;letter-writing&lt;/a&gt;, or add some &lt;a href="http://www.vanschneider.com/work/mail/"&gt;nifty new tricks&lt;/a&gt;. Others insist that better email clients are not the solution - that we need to stop using email as a catch-all reference list and task tool, and &lt;a href="http://chrisbowler.com/journal/is-email-broken"&gt;start using tools&lt;/a&gt; fit for the jobs we are trying to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think that's wrong. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's being suggested is that we stop living our lives in email, and start storing our to-do lists, our project management, and our relationships elsewhere. But that is a bad idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Almost everyone on the internet has an email account. Almost all of those email accounts are full of rich information about personal relationships, day-to-day habits, purchases, obligations, decisions, and liabilities. If someone has a long digital history, it's almost certainly in email. If someone received a touching thank-you note, it was probably through email. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If someone wanted to backup their messages, they could probably figure out how to do that with email. If they wanted to access their information on a new device, they could figure out how to do that with email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Email is universally supported. Email is uniquely persistent. Email works with everything. Email keeps your history. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Email is everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you succeed in getting users to move information out of their email accounts, you're probably succeeding in getting them to lose that data in a few years. Nobody can keep up with all the social networks, to-do apps, and document formats that come and go. Everybody can at least comprehend email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Somewhere deep, users know this. This is why, despite the explosion in apps and websites offering to hold onto that precious information for you, users have clung to their inboxes, persistently stuffing their information into the one repository they really understand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please don't persuade them to do otherwise. Just because something is new and shiny, doesn't mean it's safe or respectful. Email will still be around in 20 years. What about your new app?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want a better to-do list, or project management tool, or CRM, you need to build that &lt;em&gt;on top&lt;/em&gt; of email. Help people use their email accounts better. Help people make better sense of their contacts. Help people view the files they've shared, and the photos they've swapped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don't limit yourself, of course. Build all kinds of great things. But instead of trying to pry people away from what they know is a long-term safe bet, allow them to keep their information where they can control it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Work with the grain of the internet, rather than against it.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2006/12/13/my-day-in-court/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2006/12/13/my-day-in-court/</link><pubDate>Wed Dec 13 18:40:00 CST 2006</pubDate><title>My Day in Court</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>So the other day I went to court.

It turns out that we had tried to buy a house a while back, and when the bank appraised the house, they came back and said, "it ain't worth that much". So the deal fell through, and our offer was legally broken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, thanks to a nice little thing called earnest money, the story doesn't end there. The earnest money should have come back to us; the contract was broken through no fault of our own, and the contract specifically stated that in that situation, we would get the earnest money back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the seller didn't see it that way. They did some shady things, our agents dropped the ball a bit, and at the end of the day, they had a decent chance of winning their argument in court.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the day of the hearing, we showed up, preparing to argue this ourselves. The opposing party showed up with their high-powered, slick-dealing, somewhat shady real estate agent. It was a David vs. Goliath battle. And then the court said we'd have to reschedule, and sent us out to discuss a possible date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So we talked to these people, and they tried their very best to intimidate us, to subtly threaten to come after us with damages, blah blah blah...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I decided to let it go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a lot of money for me, but not THAT much money. Not enough to want to go through the court process again; not enough to want to spend my time thinking about it; not enough to make me want to devote my mental energy to these shady, scummy people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I wrote it off. I KNEW that I shouldn't have gotten involved in the court system in the first place; I knew it wasn't a place I wanted to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"Make friends quickly with your opponent at law while you are with him on the way, so that your opponent may not hand you over to the judge, and the judge to the officer, and you be thrown into prison." - Jesus, Matthew 5:25&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jesus took a dim view of the legal system. He suggested alternative ways for resolving issues...and if those didn't work, he told people to just let it be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Might be something I should take into consideration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-micah&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.reddingbrothers.com/"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.reddingbrothers.com/"&gt;http://www.reddingbrothers.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2005/02/11/the-forgotten/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2005/02/11/the-forgotten/</link><pubDate>Fri Feb 11 15:18:00 CST 2005</pubDate><title>The Forgotten</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>Okay, so this one lady remembers her son dying, but everyone else thinks she's crazy.

She never had a son, according to her husband, her doctor, the neighbors. Her photo albums are empty, her home videos are blank.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But she still remembers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She finally convinces someone else to remember their child as well. Suddenly, NSA agents are chasing her all over the city. She's on the run - from the government, the police, and apparently, alien forces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People start zipping up into the sky, snatched by these mysterious forces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turns out the aliens are running experiments on humanity. They're trying to get her to forget, to dissolve the bond between mother and child. And she's the only one it doesn't work with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the aliens finally grabs her and personally erases her earliest memory of her child.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And still she remembers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that means the alien has failed. His superiors are very angry, and he is whisked up into the sky, presumably to be punished for his failure. She gets her kid back, and everything goes back to the way it was. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which just goes to show: the thing you can count on is that, when dealing with entities, human or alien or whatever, one thing is always the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bureaucracy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 2 Flying Saucers&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/the-three-jobs-of-the-future/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/the-three-jobs-of-the-future/</link><pubDate>Mon Apr 04 13:49:40 CDT 2016</pubDate><title>The Three Jobs in Our Future</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>The other day I posted a hypothesis I was working on, and stirred up some wide-ranging discussion on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/micahtredding/status/716391871321358336).

After a while, this kind of thing becomes difficult to squeeze into 140-character chunks, so I thought I would unpack my thinking a bit more here. My hypothesis was this: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the future, there are only three jobs. Those jobs are: Software Developer, Storyteller, and Customer Service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, I probably could have chosen better names for these. But the point isn’t that these are the jobs we’ll keep doing, but that these jobs represent the approaches that everything else will converge on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The way I see it, over time our particular toolsets become less significant. Medium, language, and field are all fluid categories, that many people will cross in their lifetimes. As things become more fluid, it stops mattering so much what specific equipment our job consists of, and starts mattering a lot more what principles, practices, and approaches we use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, it’s not &lt;em&gt;what do you do?&lt;/em&gt;, it’s &lt;em&gt;how do you provide value?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As far as I can see, there are three main answers to that question. We either &lt;em&gt;create processes&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;create meaning&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;create connection&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everything practical falls into the realm of &lt;em&gt;processes&lt;/em&gt;. It doesn’t matter whether we’re talking about the medicine you take for acid reflux, or the work your accountant does for you. If it’s something that helps keep the world running, then it’s almost certainly about the efficient operation of some concrete process. How do you remember to take your medicine? How does your pharmacist insure you got the correct prescription and dosage? How did your doctor determine what issue needed to be addressed, and what the correct way of addressing it was? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of those things are processes, and they are processes that people try to make more efficient over time. The doctor doesn’t want to make a wild guess every time they see someone with a particular set of symptoms. They want to have a predetermined set of questions, and a way of dealing with the different answers that might come up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, they want to turn their job into an efficient system, so that they can deal with the bigger-picture issues that arise, and the rare occasions when none of the questions or answers seem to fit. We call such a system an &lt;em&gt;algorithm&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Creating algorithms is the work of a &lt;em&gt;Software Developer&lt;/em&gt;. But Software Developers only seem to be unique in the fact that they &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; this is their job. Another way to put it is this: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Software Developer’s job is to automate their job out of existence—and then to move on to the next level of abstraction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My argument is that nothing else about this actually matters. The Software Developer will go through many languages, many frameworks, and many toolsets during their career. The only constant is that they work with, and create, algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But working with algorithms is the real job in many other fields. I’m increasingly aware that my wife, who works in accounting, is engaged in a job that mostly consists of trying to create algorithms. The main difference is that the core language she works with is not typically thought of as a programming language. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I see no reason for this to continue to be the case. As our toolsets evolve, and career barriers become more fluid, I think it will become increasingly obvious that many, many people are engaged in algorithmic engineering. As that happens, principles and processes for working with algorithms will become more and more standardized across fields, and will ultimately become part of one larger vocabulary. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That leaves &lt;em&gt;creating meaning&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;creating connection&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If everything practical, process-driven, and algorithmic is handled by the first group, then the infrastructure of society and life is taken care of, and other human needs we have begin to surface. And one of the first things we start to ask is &lt;em&gt;What is the meaning of life?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What we are really asking, of course, is &lt;em&gt;What is the meaning of MY life?&lt;/em&gt; And I want to tentatively suggest that the point of that question is so that we can then ask, &lt;em&gt;now what do I do?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The way we figure out what to do is to tell ourselves stories about the world we live in, and the role we play in it. Those stories range from grand cosmic narratives, to small-scale career and workplace and family dramas. We are constantly narrating our lives, and using that narration to interpret the events happening all around us. This allows us to know what kinds of action to take, and how to react to the things we experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But we don’t craft these inner narratives from scratch. Instead, we borrow “templates” from other people in our society. And these templates ultimately come to us through the work of people who are good at crafting stories. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I call the people who create meaning the &lt;em&gt;Storytellers&lt;/em&gt;. Here, too, I don’t think our particular choices of toolset or medium are relevant. The ultimate medium for stories is not cinema or paper or screen, but the human mind. It doesn’t really matter how we get it there—the work of creating meaning is the work of crafting stories that work in the messy mental landscapes of human beings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that brings us to the last category, &lt;em&gt;creating connection&lt;/em&gt;. Because even after the practical needs of life are taken care of, and we feel ourselves to be caught up in a meaningful story, we still crave connection. Whether touch, sight, taste, or smell—whether looking into another human’s eyes, or feeling someone’s touch—we want to sense that we are not alone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Often, we don’t simply want our doctors to be algorithm-generating machines. We want someone to hear us and understand our concerns. We want to be dealt with &lt;em&gt;relationally&lt;/em&gt;, even in the midst of something incredibly technical and pragmatic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have rather flippantly called that &lt;em&gt;Customer Service&lt;/em&gt;, but it encompasses roles from priest to therapist to community organizers and international ambassadors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And I think it plays a huge role in our future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So these are the three ultimate jobs as I see them: Software Developer, Storyteller, Customer Service. Creating processes, creating meaning, creating connection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There will always be infrastructure to maintain. There will always be people hungry for meaning. We will always want each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s how I see the future. What do you see? What might I be missing?&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2005/04/13/another-flyer/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2005/04/13/another-flyer/</link><pubDate>Wed Apr 13 03:59:00 CDT 2005</pubDate><title>Another Flyer</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>Hannah Bird, who is another fantabulous individual helping us out, made up her own awesome flyer.

So there is no &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; for me to defend it, no need for me to present it as something other than the record of a primitive tribe’s violent impulses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So this is not apologetics, but something I truly and deeply see:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Hebrew scriptures are one of the most beautiful and nuanced collections of literature the world has ever produced.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, much of it is violent. It records the history of a violent world, and of a necessarily violent people within that world. There is no excusing that violence. There is no minimizing the horror of that violence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But to stop with that realization is to miss what these people, in the midst of dark and hopeless circumstances, did. Most of them were writing from the position of slaves, exiles, or vagabonds. Most of them were in the position of looking at power from the outside. And so, as they wrote and collected their histories and genealogies, they wove together the most thorough indictment of violence and corruption the world has ever seen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like all great literature, these stories don’t tell, they &lt;em&gt;show&lt;/em&gt;. They pull back the curtain and show us the truth - and they expect us to be able to come to our own conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most obvious examples of this is the story of Abraham and the sacrifice of Isaac.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Up to this point, Abraham had seen his god as being like every other god in the world - petty, demanding, and hungry for blood. And so when Yahweh asked Abraham to sacrifice his son, Abraham knew that this was the cost of having divine protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scene had played itself out a thousand times. A father leads his son to the altar, raises the knife, and strikes. The body is offered to the god, and the god is pleased.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when Abraham raised his knife, God stopped him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ancient Jews would have read this as a rejection of human sacrifice. Their God had refused to accept human flesh. Not only that, but Abraham had been stopped at the point of the kill - the point where he could see and contemplate just what he had been about to do. This was not an intellectual rejection of human sacrifice - it was a rejection that was supposed to sink deep into the psyche of every parent in Israel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But more than that, they would have understood that Isaac, &lt;em&gt;their father&lt;/em&gt;, was the one almost killed. Every other deity championed the strong, the warriors, the ones who held the knife. Every other people claimed descent from someone who had murdered his way to the top. But the Jews claimed descent from someone who was almost the &lt;em&gt;victim&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This story served to generate empathy. Every time a Jew raised a knife, he could not help but see himself as potentially killing the chosen son. And every time a human was led to the slaughter, a Jew could not help but think about their own origins, and how that could have easily been &lt;em&gt;them&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this reason, the Hebrew scriptures give us some of the most sober story-telling anywhere. Rather than glorify and exaggerate the qualities of their leaders, they systematically unveil their flaws, corruption, and crimes. Rather than suggesting that the victims “deserved it”, they show us that the ones being killed &lt;em&gt;by Jewish heroes&lt;/em&gt; were actually innocent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The more we look into this, the more amazing it is. Moses, Solomon, David - all of their sordid affairs, murders, and conspiracies are clearly laid out. The more highly regarded a figure is in Jewish culture, the more the text focuses on their corruption. Rather than justifying their actions or their violence, the text lays out just how bad it really was. Rather than suggesting that these leaders were “in the right”, it shows us that they were unquestionably in the wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus the profound irony of seeing the Hebrew bible as a book of violence and bloodlust. All of these things are there because the authors are trying to capture and expose the unflinching truth of their world - a world in which everyone was involved in murder and scapegoating. They include violence not to condone it, but to reflect it back, so that the world could see its horror.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I find this deeply inspiring. In the midst of immeasurable violence, they dared to think that humanity was &lt;em&gt;not meant&lt;/em&gt; to live in violence. Instead, they gave us a &lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/04/28/image-god"&gt;mythology&lt;/a&gt; in which humans were made to live in peace and in ongoing creation and innovation. They asserted that the world of human sacrifice and warfare was temporary and unnatural.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the true basis for the “unrealistically” loving God of the New Testament. It is what Jesus saw when he read the scriptures - what convinced him to completely reject violence himself. And this is why he went to the cross - not to appease an angry god, but as an attempt to overpower the imperial system of violence with his own compassion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within a few hundreds years, both crucifixion and the system of ancient human sacrifice were completely gone. And humanity was on the way to realizing what the Hebrew scriptures had asserted: that violence was not an inescapable part of the human condition, but something to be rejected and pushed back as humanity moved forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is unfortunate that Christians have done so little to publicize these characteristics of the Hebrew bible. But this is not an isolated or new understanding. &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Girard"&gt;René Girard&lt;/a&gt; has done a great deal of scholarly work on it. Jesus himself made clear that this is how he read the scriptures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the New Testament says what it means “out loud”, the Hebrew scriptures show us the truth in a way that has the power to change our mentality, to generate empathy and compassion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And this is the final irony. Many modern readers, upon confronting the Jewish text, recoil in horror at the violence they see there. The irony is that this is exactly what the original authors intended.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2008/12/19/reading-the-bible-literally/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2008/12/19/reading-the-bible-literally/</link><pubDate>Fri Dec 19 17:22:00 CST 2008</pubDate><title>Reading the Bible literally?</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>I'm not going to use this post to critique literal readings of the Bible.

Instead, I want to paraphrase The Princess Bride, and point out: "I don't think that word means what you think it means".&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A long time ago, a preacher I knew told me about another preacher who offended his congregation. What did the congregation do? According to my friend: "They literally crucified him!"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except that they only got angry. No crosses or nails were used to express their anger. So, um, "literal" is probably the exact wrong word to use there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have the same reaction when I hear people talking about whether they take the Bible literally or not. A common conversation might go like this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Vaguely Christian Person: "The Bible teaches that God hates gay people."&lt;br /&gt;Vaguely unChristian Person: "Wait, you don't take the Bible literally, do you?"&lt;br /&gt;Vaguely Christian Person: "Yep, every word."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The funny thing to me is that "taking the Bible literally" is the very last thing either of them should be concerned about in this conversation. No one that I know has ever suggested the passages on homosexuality are "figurative".&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bigger issues are "Does the Bible teach that homosexual activities are sinful?", "Does it teach that God hates sinners?", "Do the passages on homosexuality need to be interpreted in light of cultural circumstances?", "Is every word of the Bible from God?", and even, "Do we take the Bible's moral pronouncements seriously?"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are big issues, and not one of them is addressed by asking whether one takes the Bible "literally" or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the Bible is rife with NON-literal metaphors like "the Lamb of God", etc, it should be obvious that "taking the Bible literally" is exactly the wrong thing to be talking about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the horrid usage of the word "literally" has caused it to be confused with "seriously" or "truthfully" or "factually". And that has led a lot of people to have knee-jerk reactions against talking about "figurative" or "metaphorical" interpretations of scripture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once, I was having a conversation with someone about being "cleansed by Jesus' blood". I mentioned that this was figurative, and she practically (but not literally) went ballistic. She kept insisting that we literally come into contact with Jesus' blood at baptism, and that his blood literally cleanses us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Consider: blood has no ability to clean anything. Christianity is not about being literally clean - it's about having sin removed. Sin is not literally dirty. Jesus' blood isn't literally around anymore, and is certainly not floating in baptismal waters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So everything about this is a metaphor. People become figuratively dirty through sin, and need a figurative cleansing. Jesus' figurative blood figuratively washes people, removing the figurative dirt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Realizing these facts doesn't in any way diminish what Jesus has done. In fact, to try to take these concepts literally just makes them creepy and weird.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Almost everything in the Bible is infused with figurative language. From Revelation, which is entirely figurative, to the parables, which mean "figurative", to the expressions like "Lamb of God" and "Bright and morning star", to Jesus' own insistence on using metaphors like "eat my body", regardless of how offensive people found them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, please stop talking as if any of our doctrinal or moral controversies are tied up with taking something "literally". Of all words, let's at least let the word "literal" be used that way.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2007/01/02/the-future-is-more-real-than-the-past/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2007/01/02/the-future-is-more-real-than-the-past/</link><pubDate>Tue Jan 02 10:21:00 CST 2007</pubDate><title>The Future is More Real Than The Past</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>Kevin Beck wrote this blog about the future.

&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The future is something that people, by and large, don't believe in. That's why I thought it was amazing when Frank Tipler, a physicist, realized that in order to do physics on any real scale, he had to study the physics of the future of the universe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why? Because THE FUTURE IS SO MUCH LARGER than the past. Even from a purely size-based analysis, using only what science currently knows, the future universe is not only hundreds (thousands, millions?) of times larger than it is now, but the future timespan of our universe is IMMENSELY longer than the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frank Tipler estimates that the universe is less than 20 billion years old, and will continue AT LEAST another 100 billion years into the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think about what life will and must do on that scale of time. Humanity is in a position to sway the entire universe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-micah&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/01/01/new-years-resolve-change/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/01/01/new-years-resolve-change/</link><pubDate>Sun Jan 01 13:11:34 CST 2012</pubDate><title>New year's resolve: change</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>This year, my only resolution is to change.

I may talk more about that later, but for now, let's admit that &lt;em&gt;change&lt;/em&gt; is what we can expect from the world, and &lt;em&gt;trying to stay the same&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;a href="http://peterrollins.net/?p=3465"&gt;what we can expect&lt;/a&gt; from ourselves. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I want to find myself open to the things that are coming. In order to better do that, I'm adopting the practice of changing something about my life every week. Nothing permanent, just a temporary adjustment to see how life looks from a different angle. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of my friends will probably swear off of chocolate, meat, or soda for the entire year. But I don't know enough about myself or the future to make that kind of decision in good conscience. Further, that abstinence will only reveal one dimension of life, one angle of experience. By changing many times, by allowing those changes to be a variety of experiences, I hope to see things in a much more nuanced light. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, I am not focusing on abstaining. There are many ways to change yourself, one of which happens to be depriving yourself of something you want. But adding something to your life is change too. The culture of self-abuse that clusters around achievement and experimentation types serves to hide the fluidity and breadth of human life, and I've tried hard not to fall into that easy pattern. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So here is the &lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/01/01/2012-week-week-changes"&gt;list of things&lt;/a&gt; I will be experimenting with, filled out as I come up with them:&lt;br/&gt;Week 1: Drink no soda.&lt;br/&gt;Week 2: A world without coffee. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;...the rest will be updated as we go. :) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm not going to ask you to adopt such a practice with me. But I am going to ask that whatever happens this year, you resolve to change. That is what it means to live. &lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2013/02/17/darkness-and-light/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2013/02/17/darkness-and-light/</link><pubDate>Sun Feb 17 01:07:13 CST 2013</pubDate><title>The Darkness and The Light</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>I have always been drawn to things which are bitter-sweet.

I remember hearing “The Lion Sleeps Tonight” as a kid, and wanting to turn it off because it was so depressing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if I was hyper-sensitive to sadness as a kid, I positively embraced it later on. I remember writing a series of short tales that I would now identify as fledgling psychological horror stories. Later, when I was writing music, I found myself progressively writing darker and darker pieces, until something in life would shake me up, and I could hit the reset button and go back to writing mildly upbeat songs. Then the process would repeat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think being drawn into the darkness like this comes from being so introspective. The inside, it seems, is always darker than the outside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But here’s what I want to say:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In those times when I’ve held most strongly to a positive and meaningful worldview, the darkness and the bitter-sweetness fit. In a beautiful and inviting universe, there is room for melancholy. It adds character and spice, it allows us to see things more clearly, it shows us a deeper and more nuanced beauty of its own. In a world of light, darkness has a home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in those times when I’ve held a negative and cynical worldview, there was no room for light. It did not and could not fit. It stuck out like a wound, an intrusion, a growth. In a world of darkness, there can be no light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I think it’s important to get the order right. If you begin by embracing meaning and goodness and positivity, then everything has a legitimate place and purpose in your world. But if you begin by embracing negativity or cynicism, then nihilism will ultimately be the only thing that fits, and it will squeeze and choke out everything else of you that there is.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/i-was-a-teenage-existentialist/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/i-was-a-teenage-existentialist/</link><pubDate>Wed Jun 15 23:23:35 CDT 2016</pubDate><title>I Was a Teenage Existentialist</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>When I was 12, I began to wonder whether I was becoming an atheist.

I couldn’t tell, of course, because while I knew I was exploring things that had turned other people into atheists, I didn’t know whether they &lt;em&gt;inevitably&lt;/em&gt; led people into atheism, or whether I was going to be an exception to what seemed like it might be the rule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I felt the possibility of atheism intensely—I felt the void opening up beneath me, I felt the utter loss of meaning that I knew I would face. In fact, I remember reading a description of this by an atheist, and being stunned by the fact that one human could capture another human’s experience so clearly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I didn’t become an atheist. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But I did bring that experience back with me. And this meant that although I believed in God, I was stuck without a way to see how that belief could have much effect on the rest of the world. I had come back from the brink of emptiness, and now I was carrying that big velvet void around with me. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The thing is, I had become an existentialist without even knowing it. I had no problem believing in God, but I couldn't see how God could provide me with meaning or purpose. In fact, in my skewed perspective, I couldn’t see how God could provide anyone with meaning or purpose. I didn’t even see how the two things might be connected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If I had been obsessed with understanding the world before, it had only intensified now. I wanted to understand everything, how it all connected, what “meaning” even means. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There weren’t a lot of answers—mostly just a lot of people wondering about the same things, unsure and uncertain about it all. But I did start noticing some connections, some things that started pulling together in unexpected ways. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My interest in religion had lead me deep into theology, and the more I dug, the more I found myself drawn towards orthodox Christian thinking. In orthodox Christianity—I read over and over—there is no deep split between the body and the spirit. The orthodox proclaim the &lt;em&gt;resurrection of the body&lt;/em&gt;, and reject as unChristian and heretical the idea that spirituality is only about our spirits. Christianity, in this view, is about God’s mission to restore and uplift, not just our souls, but the entire cosmos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, my interest in science and technology was leading me deeper into conversations about the ultimate limits of life in the universe, and the possibilities that stretched out in front of us as a species. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It would have been easy to dismiss a lot of this as speculation, but that was clearly not an option. Looking back over our history as human beings, the people who thought “things will never change, we’ve reached our ultimate limits” were &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Science and technology had paved the way for me to see the possibilities for life in the universe, orthodox theology had given me a vision for that pursuit, and both of these had surprisingly affirmed the value of something I was sorely lacking:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before I stumbled into orthodox thinking, it was hard for me to see the value and &lt;em&gt;meaning&lt;/em&gt; of action. Sure, we were commanded to do good things—like feeding the hungry, and caring for widows—and the people around me were great examples of this. But it was hard to see that as anything other than isolated and arbitrary. Perhaps life was a sort of test, and these were the things you had to do to pass—but they certainly weren’t the main ordeal. The main focus had to be the time and energy spent on spiritual growth, and spiritual growth surely meant knowing and being convinced of the answers to increasingly arcane questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The irony is that I felt most alive and most passionate when I was doing hard physical work, helping people in various sorts of trouble. In a sense, my &lt;em&gt;spirit&lt;/em&gt; was connecting with something my &lt;em&gt;spirituality&lt;/em&gt; had no room for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But after encountering traditional theology, this changed. It wasn’t just helping a few people when they needed it—there was a whole world of life and living to engage in. The sense that there were a few isolated physical events that just happened to have &lt;em&gt;meaning&lt;/em&gt; gave way to the realization that these few events were like islands breaking through the water, part of a giant island chain of meaning and significance below the surface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Helping the poor and needy wasn’t just a &lt;em&gt;good deed&lt;/em&gt;, it was a way of supporting more life and more living. Rescuing people in trouble wasn’t just a moral duty, it was a way of affirming and sustaining the unfolding value of life itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That meant that everything around me—from meals to movies, from shoes to supernovas to downhill skiing—was significant, and worthy of exploration and engagement. Over time, I got very interested in the magic that happens in the creation of music, and the very different magic that happens in the world of computer programming. I was drawn towards cosmopolitanism, drinking in all that the culture was producing and had to offer. I wanted to travel—to fully and completely encounter the diversity of the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, none of this worked for me unless I could imagine a bigger and even more diverse future ahead. All the world could only have significance if it was all connected, and the only way it could all be connected was if it shared a future. Not a future of uniformity—not some intensely-sculpted hierarchical vision like the architects of the 20th century had planned—but rather a future with all the room in the world, where every life, every idea, every creation had the space to breathe and grow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was a future seen most clearly through the imaginations of people like Carl Sagan, Isaac Asimov, and CS Lewis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These days, I’m not completely free of existential dread. But I think I have found the meaning of “meaning” — the sense that things are connected, that they have significance to each other, that they support each other in building a shared future. Now that I think of it, that’s what we mean by “relationship”. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good science and good science fiction help us zoom out and see the bigger picture — the vast network of relationships that we’re all a part of. Good theology helps point us toward the future, and provoke us to action. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking around at the vast unfolding network of life I’m part of right now — and knowing that I can take action and contribute to it in meaningful ways — feels like all the significance in the world.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2004/11/10/coffee-connection-tickets-on-sale-now/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2004/11/10/coffee-connection-tickets-on-sale-now/</link><pubDate>Wed Nov 10 03:33:00 CST 2004</pubDate><title>Coffee Connection Tickets on Sale Now!</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>After 3 weeks of not hearing the Redding Brothers live, aren't you dying for their refreshing sound?

Because politics is all about everything that is worst in the world. Political races are brutal struggles for power. Power that is then used to steal, murder, cheat, lie, and corrupt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What, after all, is the source of government power? In the final analysis, it all comes down to violence. Guns and violence. If you don't pay your taxes, they will use guns to force you to do so. If you don't wear your seatbelt, they will fine you. And that fine means nothing except for the fact that if you don't pay it, they will ultimately threaten you with violence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taxes are just prettied up theft.&lt;br /&gt;Federal laws are no different than the rules laid down by the local mob.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the legitimacy of the government is just fancy clothing on a rotten corpse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-micah&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2007/12/17/two-views-of-jesus/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2007/12/17/two-views-of-jesus/</link><pubDate>Mon Dec 17 10:42:00 CST 2007</pubDate><title>Two Views of Jesus</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>I read an article the other day which was intent on drawing the battle lines across our culture.It stated that there were two views of Jesus in common circulation: the view that Jesus is God, and the ...</description><content:encoded>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I read an article the other day which was intent on drawing the battle lines across our culture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It stated that there were two views of Jesus in common circulation: the view that Jesus is God, and the view that Jesus was a social radical who preached a revolutionary message.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read that again. The two views aren't "Jesus is God" vs. "Jesus was just a man". The two views are "Jesus is ranked as equal to God" vs. "Jesus taught important things". This author is contrasting two views of what is perceived to be most significant about Jesus. Is it more important what Jesus' rank and status was, or what he taught and did?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Christian's answer was that it is more important what Jesus' rank was. It is more important to see Jesus as having the rank of "God" than to understand his teachings. And in a twisted way, I can see how this makes sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this is a common approach among Christians. Rather than worry about understanding the social significance of Jesus to his people and time, all we have to do is fill in the right name on our diagram of heaven. Thus, "Jesus" becomes simply another word for "God", and the Jesus these people pray to wears a white robe and emanates rays of light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I think both of these views miss the point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If we understand Jesus as simply a social teacher and radical, we miss the fact that Jesus is revealing to us that &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;God is like this&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And if we accept Jesus as "God", but don't understand what he did or taught, then we've missed the whole point of Jesus coming in the first place:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...to show us that &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;God is unlike anything we ever imagined&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2014/09/02/comprehensiveness-orthodoxy/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2014/09/02/comprehensiveness-orthodoxy/</link><pubDate>Tue Sep 02 08:00:48 CDT 2014</pubDate><title>The Comprehensiveness of Orthodoxy</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>Many people who use the word “orthodoxy” as a weapon, think of it as an insistence on picking the one correct answer out of many possible.

I think this misses the point pretty badly. Orthodoxy isn’t the insistence on finding the one correct answer — it’s the insistence on avoiding over-simplification.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, one of the earliest conflicts over what became orthodoxy was provoked by the teachings of Marcion. Marcion wanted to throw out all of the Old Testament and most of the New Testament, and thus establish a Christianity that had no reference to Jews or Judaism. For a gentile world, this was undoubtedly appealing. Jewish history and culture was hard to understand, the Old Testament seemed rather cruel, and wouldn’t it be better if we just stripped things down to the basics?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Orthodoxy insisted otherwise. Yes, Judaism was complex, and the Old Testament stories were tough to grapple with, but ultimately, to lose those would be to lose richness, depth, and complexity. To hold on to the full set of scriptures in all their nuance, was to hold on to the most robust and diverse version of Christianity possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, we have four gospels instead of one. The earliest Christians weren’t concerned that there might seem to be conflicts or disagreements between these accounts. Instead, they knew that to hold on to all four gospels was to allow a “four dimensional” picture of Jesus to emerge. Again, they insisted on richness and complexity instead of uniformity and over-simplification.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But perhaps the clearest example of this is in the question of the divinity of Jesus. Various early versions of Christianity wanted either a human Jesus, or a divine one. Orthodoxy wanted to hold on to both. And so the formula emerged: Jesus is fully God, fully man. 100% human, 100% divine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people have critiqued this over the years for being seemingly nonsensical. If it’s math, it doesn’t work. But for richness of expression, for depth of experience, for generation of insight and creativity and art — it absolutely does work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And so orthodoxy emerged, not as the simplest and most straightforward set of answers, but as the richest and most comprehensive, diverse, and generative stream of thought possible; the stream that gathered up everything valuable it could find, and wouldn’t let any of it go.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/06/05/first-day-peru/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/06/05/first-day-peru/</link><pubDate>Tue Jun 05 05:56:58 CDT 2012</pubDate><title>First day in Peru</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>*I'm in the middle of a 40-day, 16 stop, 14 country tour of the world.

These are my experiences.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So perhaps my pen will behave. We have just missed a flight to Singapore, and I'm guessing we will be spending our first (unscheduled) night in the airport. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seems like a good time to recount the trip so far. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lima, Peru - day 1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We arrived at 4am on an overnight flight from Miami, touched down in Lima, Peru, and disembarked to try to figure out our surroundings. As far as we knew, our next flight was scheduled for that afternoon, leaving us with several hours in which to explore the city. We wanted to get a cab, take it to the historic center, and have a look around before darting back to the airport. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would have preferred to walk, but as I soon realized, airports are not &lt;em&gt;near&lt;/em&gt; anything. And as the information desk attendant warned me, this was "coyote territory". So a cab it was. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But our first attempt to get swindled by a cab driver ended when an airport official warned us against going anywhere in Lima while it was still dark. She pretty much made us promise to wait, and apparently the cab driver couldn't operate without her permission. So we waited, while the cab driver periodically came by and inquired "now is good?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around 8am, we decided that we were ready to venture out, and went looking for our driver, to no avail. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So we began negotiating with the other drivers. They asked for 50 &lt;em&gt;soles&lt;/em&gt;, but I had already figured out that the official rate was 45, so I asked 30, and then accepted their 45 counter-offer. Learning to negotiate. Baby-steps. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Off we went, on the craziest ride of my life. I've ridden in cars in the middle east, but this was worse. I couldn't keep my mouth closed, I was so shocked. At every moment, we were squeezing in between two other cars, or between a car and a bus, or around a motorcyclist - or being shoved out of the way by some combination of those things.  There was no physical contact, but the whole system operated by threatening as if there would be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were no lanes, so every driver was trying to squeeze between and around every other driver. Buses came frighteningly close to my face. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally we pulled clear of rush hour and took off careening down a street that looked like an alleyway, weaving around buses, pedestrians, pushcarts, darting animals, and other drivers. It looked like a car commercial where they try to show just how good their brakes and steering really are. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After 20 minutes of this, we made it to the historic center, where we left the driver with instructions to meet us back there at 11am, and he left us with Spanish-language instructions we didn't understand. Except for the part about rogue taxi drivers who would kidnap us. Or something. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So off we went around the beautiful square. Armed police were everywhere, including some with heavily banged up riot shields. Nevertheless, the city seemed friendly. We peered through gates, snapped surreptitious photos of the guards, and tried not to get pick-pocketed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At midmorning, they opened the San Francisco Church catacombs, and we decided to get a quick tour of this place where something like 20,000 bodies were buried. The "combs" themselves were musky and made it hard to breathe. I'm sure the dust of all those bones, which someone had once decided to sort into piles of like kinds - skulls over here, femurs over here, leg bones all in a pile over there - didn't help. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the end of it, I was having trouble breathing, and we were 10 minutes away from our scheduled cab ride, which left me heaving and coughing as we ran back through the streets towards the center. And there was our cab-driver, waiting for us, looking relieved and thrilled that we had survived. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back we went, through the streets and alleys, around wagons and dogs and dogs and dogs. Into the airport, checked in, boarding passes printed, up to security -&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where someone finally informed us that our flight wasn't until the next day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Somehow, we had convinced ourselves that we had less than a day in Lima. And we were wrong. And now we had to find a place to spend the night. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If this were happening now, I probably would just sleep in the airport. But we decided to get a hostel. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Utilizing the airport Starbucks wifi, we found a hostel, booked it online, and proceeded to try to arrange airport pickup. The hostel had advertised airport pickup and English-speaking staff, however, three tense phone calls with them indicated that their ads did not match reality. After they agreed to pick us up and never came, we ended up finding our own transportation.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cab driver did not like our selection. "This is for them, not for you!" he kept telling us, pointing to the neighborhood, the locals, the dogs carelessly hanging off the rooftops. Sure enough, we finally arrived at our hostel - a scary looking building at end of a dirt alley. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We began to fruitlessly pound the door for several minutes. When our driver got out and did it for us, we finally got someone to open up. Even though the person who came to the door couldn't speak English (again, contrary to the ads), we managed to get them to give us a room. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We then locked ourselves in that room, and didn't emerge until morning. We were too afraid - of our hosts, of the neighborhood itself, of all the warnings the locals were giving us. Besides, we really needed to sleep. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So we slept, and outside the window, dogs hung off rooftops, pushcart drivers with loudspeakers hawked fruit and the offer to cart off your broken electronics, and some invisible neighbors played Elvis songs on electric guitar until dusk. And then the whole street experienced 30 minutes of intense activity before settling down for the night. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I slipped out of my room, up a floor, and onto the open roof, where I could slide between the dry-hanging sheets and look down on the whole thing. If this had been America, I would have been standing in a forbidden area. But in Peru, I wasn't so sure. And so I stood there between the sheets and the wall, underneath an old unused billboard, staring out at the neighborhood around me, and the city of Lima beyond it. &lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/07/19/mountain-bested-me/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/07/19/mountain-bested-me/</link><pubDate>Thu Jul 19 09:52:08 CDT 2012</pubDate><title>The Mountain That Bested Me</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>*From my [trip journal](http://micahredding.com/blog/series/around-world-40-days) -

The tourist office informed us there were no such hikes, but the Internet said otherwise, and we decided to trust the Internet. Supposedly, this trail would lead to the top of Mount Putucusi, from which we could look down on Machu Picchu. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, we had to follow the road out of town, and then follow the train tracks farther. Technically, it is very illegal to walk on the train tracks; however, train tracks are pretty much the only roads available, and the locals don't seem to know how many laws they are breaking as they walk, bike, push wheelbarrows, and take large groups of tourists down these same tracks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So we walked over the train bridge, knowing that if we saw the train tunnel, we had gone too far. Fortunately, the trail itself was pretty easy to spot. It led up into the foliage, just prior to the big warning sign which I couldn't read. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Off we went, up stone stairs cut into the underbrush. The trail (staircase?) wove back and forth, through thickets, around trees, and up the mountain. At a certain point, it topped out, allowing us an amazing view of the mountains around, and the small village of Aguas Calientes nestled in between them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://res.cloudinary.com/micahredding/image/upload/v1453076449/2012-05-22_2012.38.02_20AM.jpg" title=""&gt;&lt;img src="http://res.cloudinary.com/micahredding/image/upload/v1453076449/2012-05-22_2012.38.02_20AM.jpg" alt="aguas calientes" title="aguas calientes" class="image-large" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then it went back down. Odd for a trail destined to lead us to the top. But down we went, and then up again. And winding around one zig-zag path, 15 feet above us, we encountered a Peruvian leprechaun. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's what we later decided to call him, anyway. He was wearing a Peruvian hat, multiple colors, and carrying a small pan flute, from which he cast haunting mountain spells, or summoned his fellow road-thieves. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was hard to tell what was going on. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So we asked him if the way forward was safe. He nodded, and then made some hand gestures for climbing up ropes. Okay, we thought, let's see what this is like. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On we went, until we found an impassible section, traversable only by a wooden ladder propped against a rock. The wooden ladder had long since fallen into disrepair. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Peruvian leprechaun, at this point, having followed us, decided to show us the way up. So up he scrambled. We were cautious, but eventually followed his lead, holding onto a conveniently fallen tree, the remains of the ladder, and parts of the underlying rock itself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not that bad. By the time we got to the top of the ladder, though, our Peruvian friend was gone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was waiting for us at the next broken ladder. This one had been partially replaced by a very long cable, bolted into the rock. It had to be something like 100 feet tall. The Peruvian man sat perched on a small rock at the bottom, showing no reaction to our puzzlement and disbelief. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We contemplated the scene in front of us for a while, and then decided to search for an alternate route. There had to be an alternate route, right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We plunged further into the brush in search of one. But while we were plunging around, a young couple we had met in Cusco came along and decided to give it a try. We returned to find them half-way up, and stuck on the piece of ladder that remained in the middle, completely cut off from the top and bottom. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Peruvian man was playing his flute. And then he apparently either got tired of watching these foreigners, or decided to show them the way. So up he scrambled, hand over hand past them, and disappeared into the bushes at the top of the cliff. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://res.cloudinary.com/micahredding/image/upload/v1453076454/2012-05-21_2010.36.26_20PM.jpg" title=""&gt;&lt;img src="http://res.cloudinary.com/micahredding/image/upload/v1453076454/2012-05-21_2010.36.26_20PM.jpg" alt="100 foot cliff, broken ladder, and a Peruvian leprechaun" title="100 foot cliff, broken ladder, and a Peruvian leprechaun" class="image-large" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://res.cloudinary.com/micahredding/image/upload/v1453076458/2012-05-21_2010.48.22_20PM.jpg" title=""&gt;&lt;img src="http://res.cloudinary.com/micahredding/image/upload/v1453076458/2012-05-21_2010.48.22_20PM.jpg" alt="100 foot cliff, broken ladder" title="100 foot cliff, broken ladder" class="image-large" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was the last we saw of him. But we decided to stay and see how our fellow travelers fared. After another twenty minutes of struggling with the ladder, they turned around and spent a harrowing 15 climbing back down. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Too risky" they told us, when we greeted each other at the bottom. I figured that if they had gotten halfway up and had THEN decided it was too risky, they probably knew what they were talking about. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But our new friends were keen to search out a new path with us. So we all trudged back into the bushes to see what we could find. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We found another cliff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://res.cloudinary.com/micahredding/image/upload/v1453076461/2012-05-21_2010.44.52_20PM.jpg" title=""&gt;&lt;img src="http://res.cloudinary.com/micahredding/image/upload/v1453076461/2012-05-21_2010.44.52_20PM.jpg" alt="Small cliff with tree root ladder" title="Small cliff with tree root ladder" class="image-large" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This one was small, only 15 feet or so. And someone had conveniently prepped our journey by pulling free a long root that we could use as a rope, and looping a branch around a tree, that we could use as a handhold. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was not confident in my abilities to climb this - period - let alone climb it with a heavy backpack, the need to get back down at some point, and a looming train schedule we had to meet. I was happy to rule out rock-climbing on this trip, and stick to long-distance hiking, and braving hostels that did not see the importance of providing lighting, towels, soap, or toilet paper. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But up our friend went. He seemed to pull it off pretty easily, but his female companion struggled with it. This was a bad sign - if a small, agile female wasn't able to easily pull herself up a tree branch-root combo, then I probably wasn't going to be able to either. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She did make it, however. Then Josiah went up. Then I took my turn. Half-way up, okay. The rest of the way involved me having no footholds, and trying desperately to dig out a barely exposed root with my fingertips, so that my root-gripping right hand would have some company in allowing me to continue to dangle over empty space. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's when a large rock came whizzing over the side, right past my face, hitting me in the arm which was supporting my entire body weight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not a confidence booster. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eventually, I was able to grip a root, switch to a bigger root, and put my arm around the small tree that was making this whole adventure possible. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I dangled there a moment, my arms the only thing holding me, and I hugged the tree while my feet swung. And then I somehow converted that hug into a much less appropriate embrace, and made my way to the top of the cliff. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think the only way I was able to pull off such a maneuver was with a quite intense surge of adrenaline. This left my whole body shaking, including my arms, legs, and my very tired hands. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Either that, or I was just traumatized by the experience of knowing I was about to fall off this cliff face, and into the forest below. Did I mention that as I was dangling, some of my fellow-travelers accidentally hit me with a large rock?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We had made it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To another one. This one was simpler, involving walking along the outside of an improvised tree root staircase. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am not generally enthusiastic about staircases in which you must grip a wall and the stairs are not beneath you. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But we made &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;. And then we climbed further along this steep pathway, and came to a ravine which desired to be clambered up, and yet did not provide the courtesy of walls which could be clambered. I was halfway up when my grip, the only rock I could find to hold, came loose. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was done. My arms and legs were shaking, and most significantly, my tolerance for confronting heights, fear, and the sensation of falling, was gone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I came back down. If we had confronted these obstacles in reverse order, it probably wouldn't have been that bad. But I was not up for facing a never-ending series of these, each one even more difficult to return from. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being a wimp as a kid turns you into an adult who does not want to back down from anything. So once I commit to something, I rarely give up. Wanting to be macho usually kicks in just long enough to get me over the hump. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But I wasn't ashamed of this. I was finished. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://res.cloudinary.com/micahredding/image/upload/v1453076466/2012-05-21_2011.55.51_20PM.jpg" title=""&gt;&lt;img src="http://res.cloudinary.com/micahredding/image/upload/v1453076466/2012-05-21_2011.55.51_20PM.jpg" alt="" title="" class="image-large" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our friends continued on, while we headed back down. When we made it back to the first obstacle, we were greeted by some other hikers at the bottom of the cliff. They saw the cliff we were climbing off of and immediately gave up. And before we finished getting down, our friends returned as well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Right above the part I had given up on, they had found another giant rock wall, with no grips, roots, or ladders. They had faced the insurmountable just beyond my limit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's probably some lesson to be learned here. But I have yet to learn it. I simply decided that I had reached my limit, and turned around and came back. And I don't regret that. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although I do wonder what might have happened if we had managed to follow that Peruvian leprechaun up the mountain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;See more of these &lt;a href="https://plus.google.com/photos/110800681150805455169/albums/5766961421771981297"&gt;photos&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/the-purpose-of-scripture-and-doctrine/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/the-purpose-of-scripture-and-doctrine/</link><pubDate>Tue Aug 15 09:33:20 CDT 2017</pubDate><title>The Purpose of Scripture &amp; Doctrine</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>I spend a lot of time thinking and talking about scripture and doctrine.

And yet, as I’ve expressed in many different ways, I believe that &lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/christianity-is-love"&gt;love is the answer&lt;/a&gt;—the truly significant factor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So why not just let the scripture &amp;amp; doctrine stuff go?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is what a lot of people ultimately do. When they study and deconstruct, it gives them permission to move away from legalism, and towards love as a core value and motivating ethic. In that process, they realize that getting it all &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; isn’t the most important thing in the world, and they eventually let go of that study altogether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So why not just do that?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this point, I’m old enough to have been through two significant deconstructions, and to watch numerous friends and colleagues go through them too. And I haven’t always felt good about what I’ve seen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many times things start out feeling like a great liberation, and then gradually wind their way to something that feels a lot more empty and hopeless. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And maybe even cynical. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people then go looking for something to fill that emptiness, and having already tried religion, they find a strong political ideology to take its place. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think that’s a dark path, and as more and more people are going through deconstruction, I want something better for them on the other side. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And I’ve realized that we are not the first generation to go through this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=%E2%80%9CChristianity%20has%20died%20many%20times%20and%20risen%20again%3B%20for%20it%20had%20a%20god%20who%20knew%20the%20way%20out%20of%20the%20grave.%E2%80%9D%20%E2%80%94%20Chesterton&amp;related=undefined&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fmicahredding.com%2Fblog%2Fthe-purpose-of-scripture-and-doctrine"&gt;“Christianity has died many times and risen again; for it had a god who knew the way out of the grave.” — GK Chesterton&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Christianity has died again and again. But each time it has been resurrected, reborn to new life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The result of those deaths and rebirths is what we experience as scripture and doctrine. They point us to the visions and values that helped previous generations find life. They didn’t find that life by rejecting everything that had come before, nor by refraining from critiquing it. Instead, they grappled with it, wrestled with it, took it into the wilderness—and came back with something new and powerful, carrying forward and revitalizing the heart of the old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is what we see in Jesus, Paul, and the first disciples. It’s what we see in Moses, David, and the prophets. It’s what we see in the Reformers, the Restorationists, and throughout church history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s what I think we need today. We cannot really cut ourselves off from our past, and so we must either reject it, or renew it. But having experienced power and beauty in something, most of us cannot bring ourselves to fully reject it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And if we don’t find our way towards renewal, we’ll be caught in a dark limbo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is my way out, my fundamental step on the path to life:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I believe in life, and I believe in humanity. And I believe in a God who believes in both.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This God calls and equips us to share his purposes. “All that I have is yours”, God says, asking us to join in and care for life and humanity just as he does. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s the &lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/partnership-with-god"&gt;entire biblical story&lt;/a&gt;. It’s the Greatest Commands. It’s love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And doctrine and scripture and all the rest—when they’re good, healthy, functional, life-giving—are how we keep reminding each other of these facts.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2004/05/24/redding-brothers-hit-the-runway-05232004/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2004/05/24/redding-brothers-hit-the-runway-05232004/</link><pubDate>Mon May 24 02:24:00 CDT 2004</pubDate><title>Redding Brothers hit the runway - 05/23/2004</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>HUNTINGTON, WV - On May 23 at 2:00 p.m., the Redding Brothers performed at the Elite Model Search "Half-Time Show" at the Huntington Mall, playing to a huge audience of contestants and bystanders.

Actually, Paducah is quite the cultured town: at least they’re trying harder than some larger cities I know of. The downtown area has become quite a tourist trap, and boasts all manner of music, art, crafts, film, food, and nightlife. Building-sized hand-painted murals are a frequent site, and brick streets lined with lamp posts are a feature as well. The riverfront, with a broad view of where the Tennessee and Ohio rivers converge, is also a great place for a weekend concert, or just kicking back and watching the boats go by, and feeling the watery breeze hit your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first challenge that we ran into was finding a suitable venue for our concert. The Market House Theater, the Carson Center, and the Robert Cherry Civic Center all emerged on the top of our list as strong possibilities. Eventually we opted for Robert Cherry because of the cost/benefit ratio and flexibility.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next struggle we had was the fact that we’d never played in this town before in our lives, and basically had no following at all. We only had 3 weekends in which to promote this show, so we knew we really had to work hard in order to get the kind of exposure it would take to bring any large number of people to the show. We planned appearances at the local FYE, various cafes and coffee shops, a carwash, a drive-in, the gazebo in the square, area restaurants and stores, different churches, and the public and private school systems in the area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We contacted the local media outlets like the Paducah Sun, eXtra Entertainment Guide, Coffee News, radio stations, etc., and got the word out that we would be in town on May 24th. Micah referred to it as a “media bomb”, where we basically showed up in town one day, totally unknown, and residents suddenly started seeing us everywhere they looked — the front page of the city paper, out on the street corner, at school, at church, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each weekend we consistently set records for ourselves for the number of shows we’d ever done in a weekend, topping out at a whopping 13 shows performed Wednesday May 16th through Sunday May 20th. Robert Cherry was to mark our 212th Redding Brothers concert ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This concert was meant to be a money-making venture to support our band, and also serve as the next step in the continual release of our latest CD The Physics of Immortality, but more importantly it was an introduction to a completely new audience that we plan on growing over time. We wanted to set a premise for how we will approach new markets that we venture into in the coming months. We wanted to see how a “total saturation” approach to marketing worked in promoting an unfamiliar act to a completely new audience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next month we’ll see how it went and what we learned as a band from the experience. See you then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Redding Brothers are an acoustically-driven rock &amp;amp; roll act from Charleston, WV, now based in Nashville, TN. You can find out more about the band, purchase concert tickets, and hear samples from their sophomore album release titled The Physics of Immortality, all by visiting their website at ReddingBrothers.com.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2009/12/28/jesus-movement/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2009/12/28/jesus-movement/</link><pubDate>Mon Dec 28 22:30:00 CST 2009</pubDate><title>Jesus Movement</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>In the first century, Jesus of Nazareth walked into history and left an impact that reverberated throughout the world.

No one before had left such a mark. In the wake of his short, amazing life, an surge of change exploded out towards the ends of the earth, and dispelled a thousand years of darkness and oppression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For several hundred years afterwards, this Messianic movement, proclaiming Jesus and his lifestyle, was the brightest and most liberating force on earth. It proclaimed the reconciliation of God and man, the forgiveness of humanity's sins, the removal of death, the equality of all races and genders and social strata, and the identity of humanity as co-workers with God.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It alone showed a path towards peace and justice for the oppressed peoples of the world. It made no compromises: for Jesus, the means &lt;i&gt;were&lt;/i&gt; the ends. The way of Jesus was to achieve peace by individually and deliberately ceasing violence our&lt;i&gt;selves&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This Jesus movement wasn't looking for a utopia. It &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; the utopia, if such a thing could even be discussed. Within their social circles, slaves and slaveholders were friends and equals. Men and women conversed freely and openly, and races and nationalities were united in a way &lt;i&gt;never before seen&lt;/i&gt; in human history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This movement was a light to the world, shaking the foundations of every institution in every nation. The outsiders, seeing this drastically different order being embodied in their midst, were shaken to their core. Governments began to crumble and fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The natural result of this world-wide disruption was a series of takeover attempts that culminated in Emperor Constantine's assumed conversion. The empire legalized Christianity, and then began the process of regulating it, turning it into a tool for the enhancement of state power. Christianity, the movement, was never the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the truth still remains, and the message is still available for anyone who wants it. Individuals throughout history have glimpsed pieces of the message, even when they didn't fall into the accepted Christian groups. These individuals grasped hold of what they saw, and ended slavery, abolished discrimination, fought violence with non-violence, and worked to transform the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This effort is ongoing, and today remains in our hands. We are the heirs of Jesus of Nazareth, a poor worker who displayed the truth more clearly than it had ever been. He spent three years in dirt and sweat and open fields, with friends and food, showing his country-men the reality that was breaking in around them. It is up to us to reclaim that message for our world.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2008/02/05/alternatives-to-politics/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2008/02/05/alternatives-to-politics/</link><pubDate>Tue Feb 05 23:32:00 CST 2008</pubDate><title>Alternatives to Politics</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>If politics is about who controls the guns (and it is), what alternatives can we create?

Here are some ideas:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most people view "law" as a series of statements about what we value. As in, "we hold marriage to be between a man and a woman". But those kinds of "laws" are just touchy-feely comments added in to make you feel nice. They're not really laws. Real laws specify who lives and who dies; who spends their life in jail, and who goes free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We could perhaps extract the one from the other. Statements of values need to be made, and are valuable in and of themselves. We could easily establish a universally recognized body which would make appropriate statements about the values of the nation. Such an entity would be known as a "Court", but would have no connection to an executive branch (unlike in the current system).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Such an entity could even judge cases, and make decisions in difficult controversies. When neighbors fought, they could bring their cases before this Court. But because this entity would have no executive branch, it would be very inclined to bring mutually acceptable resolutions to bear for both parties. When this failed, the judgment of the Court would be held by the country as most likely being the truth, and people who were aware of the case would use this information in choosing how to behave towards the guilty party.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any executive groups that developed, like security or police forces, would use the judgment of the Court as the basis of how people are treated. If they interacted with a criminal who had been judged guilty, they might feel free to lock that person up for an appropriate amount of time. The security force would be hesitant to abuse their power, as they would rely on the endorsement of the Court to drum up new business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this case, we've extracted violence from any kind of government-like organization, and put it in the hands of small, de-centralized citizen groups. That may be the recipe for less control, but it's also certainly the recipe for less fascism.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, we've switched from creating "laws" to having a "central standards organization", much as we have for web programming. In web programming, we have no laws, we just have recommendations from a central, trusted group. And they accomplish more than laws ever could.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've presented just one possibility here. What are some others?&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2006/12/22/featured-on-christmas-blog/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2006/12/22/featured-on-christmas-blog/</link><pubDate>Fri Dec 22 06:46:00 CST 2006</pubDate><title>Featured on Christmas Blog</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>I just got word that my blog has been featured on Adam's yearly Christmas blog-post, linked here:http://adamsweb.us/blog/index.php/a/2006/12/21/carnival_of_christmas_iiThey picked it up because of my ...</description><content:encoded>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I just got word that my blog has been featured on Adam's yearly Christmas blog-post, linked here:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://adamsweb.us/blog/index.php/a/2006/12/21/carnival_of_christmas_ii"&gt;&lt;a href="http://adamsweb.us/blog/index.php/a/2006/12/21/carnival_of_christmas_ii"&gt;http://adamsweb.us/blog/index.php/a/2006/12/21/carnival_of_christmas_ii&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They picked it up because of my post about &lt;a href="http://thereddingbrothers.blogspot.com/2006/12/my-favorite-christmas-carol.html"&gt;my favorite Christmas Carol&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He has an interesting post about lying to your kids about Santa.

It has been the reason that most of the atheists in history became atheists. And Christians have never been able to answer it. They've tried, in many different fashions; but they've all failed.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;All of the answers given so far diminish some attribute of God. And most lead us towards Christianity's number one philosophical adversary: gnosticism. Gnosticism basically postulates that there are two gods, one good and one evil, locked in a semi-eternal struggle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Good God can't keep out evil because he's not fully in control; the Evil God (Satan) currently has power over the earth. This is probably the closet view of the majority of Christians, but Christianity has always rejected this notion, and for good reason. According to the bible, only one God is all-powerful, and all evil forces work only because he allows them to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gnosticism is tempting because it seems to solve the Problem of Evil, but it does so at the expense of God's power. It draws a Satan almost co-equal with God, and along the way introduces several other concepts which have rippling effects: the idea that flesh is bad and spirit is good, the concept of the physical creation being corrupt and good only for destruction, and the concept that our whole society and world is going downhill. Christianity has always rejected all of these ideas as well, and yet they've always managed to creep in. They creep in because gnosticism seems to give us an answer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A common answer to the Problem of Evil is to simply say that evil is Satan's fault. But this is like saying that you were babysitting your kids, and the neighborhood bully decided to come in and beat them up, so you just stood aside and watched it happen. Then, when people accused you of being a bad parent, you pointed out that it wasn't YOU who beat the kids up, it was the bully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If God is not powerful enough to stop Satan, then gnosticism is true, and God's power is diminished. But if God is powerful enough to stop things, and yet just sits by and watches Satan work, then he is not really all-loving. Either God is not really in control, or God is a negligent parent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;But the situation gets worse, because if we blame Satan for all evil, we have to deal with how the bible presents the relationship between God and Satan. And that relationship is not one of constantly interlocked fighting. God is not in a struggle against Satan which is tough for him to win. Just look at the account in Job: Satan asks to commit evil against Job, and God gives him permission. Worse yet, God actually pointed out that Job needed testing in the first place!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Probably the most popular current answer to the Problem of Evil is to say that all evil is the result of Adam's sin. But this is not really an answer.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;If we say that Adam caused all evil, then we still have the problem of why God does not intervene to stop this evil. This is like saying that you were babysitting your kids, and they started hacking at each other with knives, and you just stood by and watched. After all, you point out, it was the kids' fault.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;If, on the other hand, we say that God caused all evil and suffering as a result of Adam's sin, then the situation is worse. God is punishing ALL of humanity with evil and suffering, as the result of one person's sin. This is like saying that you were babysitting your kids, and one of them disobeyed you, so you set them to fighting with each other as punishment.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of these arguments serve only to disguise the blame, not actually to deal with it. All of these answers do one of two things: they give up some of God's power, making him less powerful against Satan, or they reduce his love for mankind. And most of them lead us down the road of gnosticism, and all the negative trappings that come with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember, the bible stands in stark opposition to all of these trains of thought. All of creation is "very good", all of it functions according to God's commands, Jesus came as a physical human, and Satan is ultimately under God's control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...to be continued...&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;Part &lt;a href="/blog/2007/05/27/the-problem-of-evil-part-1-the-unanswered-question"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="/blog/2007/06/03/the-problem-of-evil-part-2-the-multiverse-vs-gnosticism"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="/blog/2007/06/03/the-problem-of-evil-part-3-and-god-saw-the-multiverse-and-it-was-good"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2005/10/08/murphys-loft-showcase-recap/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2005/10/08/murphys-loft-showcase-recap/</link><pubDate>Sat Oct 08 19:27:00 CDT 2005</pubDate><title>Murphy's Loft Showcase Recap</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>The Murphy's Loft showcase was great.

Researchers at the University of Wisconsin-La Crosse conducted a study for the American Council on Exercise that showed &lt;a href="http://www.reddingbrothers.com/"&gt;wearing jeans&lt;/a&gt; and other casual clothing to work resulted in an 8 percent increase in physical&lt;br /&gt;activity and nearly 500 more steps compared to more formal attire days. Those&lt;br /&gt;casual Fridays—and Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays—translated to an extra 25 calories burned per day, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hmmm...who would have guessed that our office-living, suited lifestyles would contribute to the downfall of America's health? But it gets more interesting:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Considering you must burn 3,500 calories to lose one pound, the added activity from casual clothing workdays could potentially offset the average weight gain experienced by Americans of 0.4 to 1.8 pounds annually.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;What they are saying is that Americans on average gain exactly the amount of weight that they could lose if they simply started wearing jeans to work. In other words, we could reduce or eliminate the obesity epidemic in America just by switching to jeans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, I've always known that wearing anything other than jeans is just wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-micah&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="technoratitag"&gt;Technorati Tags:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/jeans" target="_blank" rel="tag" title="Link to Technorati Tag category for jeans"&gt;jeans&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/rock+music" target="_blank" rel="tag" title="Link to Technorati Tag category for rock music"&gt;rock music&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/save+the+world" target="_blank" rel="tag" title="Link to Technorati Tag category for save the world"&gt;save the world&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/rock+and+roll" target="_blank" rel="tag" title="Link to Technorati Tag category for rock and roll"&gt;rock and roll&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/rock" target="_blank" rel="tag" title="Link to Technorati Tag category for rock"&gt;rock&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/health" target="_blank" rel="tag" title="Link to Technorati Tag category for health"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/blue+jeans" target="_blank" rel="tag" title="Link to Technorati Tag category for blue jeans"&gt;blue jeans&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2011/10/10/thoughts-science-and-religion/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2011/10/10/thoughts-science-and-religion/</link><pubDate>Mon Oct 10 07:45:56 CDT 2011</pubDate><title>Thoughts on Science and Religion</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>The relationship between science and religion has been discussed and debated for a long time now, with very little apparent progress in many quarters.

I admire the genius of the scientific process, I adopt the scientific sensibility, and I value the progression of science as one of the most valuable things human beings do. But I'm also very religious. For me, this is an incredible combination, the chance to explore the intersection of human ideas as the deepest level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But for many, it's a really difficult confrontation, usually resolved with a little bit of denial, and a lot of cognitive dissonance. Efforts to &lt;em&gt;fix&lt;/em&gt; the conflict have usually only dealt with part of the issue. Religion is a complex, multi-layered phenomenon, and cannot be easily fixed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So let me see if I can slice this up somewhat, and see where the tensions are coming from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Non-overlapping magisteria?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Steven J. Gould famously promoted the idea that science and religion are from two "non-overlapping magisteria" - that science deals with matters of fact in the natural world, while religion deals with issues of value and morality. The Catholic church appears to adopt such a view as it relates to evolution, which seems to be the most common place for the issue to be raised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is some validity to this view. Matters of value &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; different than traditional matters of fact. Values are choices we make, facts are not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But religion is more than a set of values, so this does not separate &lt;em&gt;religion&lt;/em&gt; from science, it merely separates "value" from science. Science and "value" are two non-overlapping magisteria. Science and religion, unfortunately, are not quite so easy to detangle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2) Ways of knowing.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is probably at the forefront of most religious-scientific debate. Religious people make certain claims ("Because God said so!") while scientists make other claims ("Because the evidence indicates it!"). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people wish to dismiss religion entirely because of this. Since the beliefs of religion weren't derived through rational processes, religion itself is a worthless endeavor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other side of the table, religious people often want to downplay the capability or validity of science. Since science is always changing, it can offer no certainty, and certainly has no ability to replace direct revelation from God.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both sides are wrong. When it comes to knowing things, the scientific method is the best and most legitimate approach humans have ever discovered. &lt;em&gt;Everything&lt;/em&gt; should bow to it. But science itself is just a process for evaluating different philosophies; where those philosophies come from is irrelevant. Some scientific theories began as horrible lab mistakes, others as the intention to take a warm bath.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Religion, then, in so much as it makes claims about reality, is a set of propositions for science to evaluate. A set of hypotheses, if you will.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3) Ways of talking.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Science and Religion have very different ways of talking. This shouldn't be a surprise - science has a different way of talking than almost anything else humans do. And religion, in general, has a way of talking that is &lt;em&gt;old&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given those two things, it's really easy for science-leaning people to dismiss religion altogether, and it's really easy for everybody else to roll their eyes at science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We need broader awareness of these facts. Ancient scriptures are &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; intended or appropriate for use in science-related discussions, from &lt;em&gt;either&lt;/em&gt; side. It is not okay for the religious person to throw scriptures into a scientific discussion, nor is it appropriate for the non-religious to use scriptures as evidence that religious people are ignorant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each religious scripture has its own context and process of interpretation. Just as it would not be appropriate for a Christian to read (and judge) the Quran in the same way they read the gospels, it is not appropriate for a non-religious person to read (and judge) ancient religious texts as if they were written in a modern style or genre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, a scriptural statement that "the sun rises and sets" should not be used by a religious person to weigh in on the nature of the solar system. Nor should it be used by a scientist as evidence that the religious text is faulty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Religion makes specific claims, and those claims need to be evaluated by science. But those claims can only be evaluated after they've been properly interpreted and translated into equivalent language.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4) Levels of analysis.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Religion, in general, operates at a very high level of analysis. Science typically operates at a very low level. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If I eat a cookie, we can talk about that on the level of fundamental forces, on the level of biochemistry, on the level of "Mmmm, that's good!", or on the level of lifestyle choices. These are not contradictory, nor do they operate in different domains or magisteria. They are talking about exactly the same thing in different ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, when we ask &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; something is happening, we can answer at the level of physics, at the level of human intention, at the level of cosmic significance, or at any level in between. It does us no good to ignore those differences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is often a problem for religious people, who want to answer questions with "God did it". Such a statement is not helpful in the discussion of scientific matters, but neither is such a statement a reason to discredit a religion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, scientifically-oriented people often want to dismiss the idea of the "soul". These people do not realize that "soul" is a description at the level of human experience, not a claim about the nature of the mind-body connection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5) Decisions.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Humans operate on assumptions. We make assumptions about reality all the time, and often find those assumptions to be untrue. But that does not mean we can stop making them. Assumptions are necessary for our survival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When dealing with religion, we are often faced with intellectual choices that we simply do not have enough information to make. We must decide whether the universe is good or evil, whether we have a purpose in life, whether the whole world is a giant conspiracy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike science, we do not have the luxury of simply abstaining from a decision. These things radically affect our lives and the world; our only option is to look at all the hints we have, evaluate to the best of our ability, and then leap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not anti-intellectual. As more data becomes available, we reevaluate, rethink, and leap again. This is the proper context for faith and hope - that when two opposing ideas fight for our allegiance, and leave us no way to determine the truth, that we lean towards goodness and light.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2008/09/04/unintended-consequences/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2008/09/04/unintended-consequences/</link><pubDate>Thu Sep 04 11:34:00 CDT 2008</pubDate><title>Unintended Consequences</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>Greg Newton posted a good piece about the Uncertainty of Justice over at Emergent Village.It's easy to talk about justice.

It's harder to actually do justice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As he points out, even something like giving food to struggling farmers can actually undermine the local economy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem is unintended consequences. Our world is a complex network, an ecosystem. Human society is an ecosystem to itself. And when you try to alter an ecosystem, you find that the task is much more complex than expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another name for this is the Butterfly Effect. A butterfly's attempts to drink nectar in America can result in a tsunami in some other part of the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Almost all political solutions sound promising. That's why they're developed, after all: to sound really good to a large number of people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the downfall of political solutions is in the doing. All political solutions result in unexpected side-effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem isn't just in politics. It's in improving the economy, saving the environment, treating diseases, waging war, and dealing with religion. Complex systems are difficult to tinker with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But complex systems are exactly what our future will consist of. And so humanity's new job is to discover the science, the technique, of working with complex systems in organic ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is our task, and our hope of survival.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2006/12/27/are-polar-bears-an-endangered-species/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2006/12/27/are-polar-bears-an-endangered-species/</link><pubDate>Wed Dec 27 05:23:00 CST 2006</pubDate><title>Are Polar Bears an Endangered Species?</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>According to the article below, the White House is considering classifying Polar Bears as an endangered species.The article points out that this is an issue because Polar Bears are loved for their app...</description><content:encoded>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.reddingbrothers.com/polarbear/"&gt;&lt;img style="float:right;cursor:pointer;width:320px;margin:0 0 10px 10px;" src="http://www.reddingbrothers.com/components/com_virtuemart/shop_image/product/b6a9442d0efd6ac9e34d0ae6c0e8e23e.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to the article below, the White House is considering classifying Polar Bears as an endangered species.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The article points out that this is an issue because Polar Bears are loved for their appearances in Coca-Cola commercials, children's toys, and now...the &lt;a href="http://www.reddingbrothers.com/polarbear/"&gt;I Heart Polar Bears tshirt&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16361087/"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16361087/"&gt;http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16361087/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an interesting thing for the Bush administration to be considering, as this is apparently a tacit acceptance of global warming. To me, the jury's still out on this, and on whether global warming is a good thing or a bad thing.

If you take the ants away from the anthill, they will build a new one. In the same way, humans will always invent and innovate. If you take away their technology, humans will invent new technology.

It's common for institutions to plow over and through people. Authority structures (which I will be getting to) have an inherent tendency to warp and destroy those within them. And often, the religious beliefs of a group are simply downright harmful in and of themselves. Given that, it's often assumed that the masses of people leaving organized religion are simply doing so because of a bad experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A friend of mine recently wrote from this viewpoint, arguing that those leaving the church were really just dissatisfied with themselves...or were unwilling to deal with the pressures and tensions of living in community. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He has a point; often we project our own problems onto others. And living in relationship and in community &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; difficult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But then again, sometimes it's not psychology. Sometimes you're just wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I believe that there is something inherently wrong with the entire idea of organized religion. I believe that organized religion grows from a root that Jesus was attempting to pull out. And I didn't come to this conclusion because I was hurt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Truthfully, I had a pretty idyllic childhood, with lots of space in which to develop my own thoughts, to question the things I was told, and to study things privately. And while I'm sure there were some harmful things about the churches I grew up in, I didn't really experience them that way. The time period in which I got to travel to youth rallies is still one of the highlights of my life, continuing to shape my aesthetic sensibility, and my sense of what humans might be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The wheat and the tares always grow together. The good is always growing within the bad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wasn't bruised by organized religion. And I'm not interested in a hospital for the survivors of abusive churches. Or rather, I'm not interested in stopping there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To me, the message of non-religious Christianity has nothing to do with hurt, and everything to do with something better that is waiting.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2004/08/13/movie-waking-life/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2004/08/13/movie-waking-life/</link><pubDate>Fri Aug 13 02:11:00 CDT 2004</pubDate><title>MOVIE - Waking Life</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>Waking Life is one of the most interesting movies I've watched in a while.

Second of all, the animation is different than anything I've seen. They actually recorded the whole movie with live-action actors and cameras and everything; and THEN went back and animated over it. As a result, the animation is very detailed, and follows real-life motion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third of all, this movie is basically one big dream sequence...consisting of random people dialoguing on philosophy. At times it's hilarious, at times profound, and often weird. It deals in depth with the idea of lucid dreaming, and how you can know if you're living in a dream or not.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you're not into philosophy, it'll probably run a little slow for you; but it is funny just because it has bizarre people randomly discussing bizarre philosophy with strangers, while walking, and while bumping into you as they pass. It even has a guy driving a boat down the highway.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In other words, this is a great movie.

Of course, you believe in them too. You may call them things like &lt;em&gt;schools&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;corporations&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;markets&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;religions&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;fads&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;technologies&lt;/em&gt;. But they are very definitely creatures - and they have their own desires, impulses, and motivations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This idea isn't new. There's plenty of sci-fi precedent for it, and lots of people have imagined the internet “coming alive” in some kind of nightmarish scenario. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main difference is that I think the internet is &lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt; alive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not that I picture it &lt;em&gt;thinking&lt;/em&gt;. I imagine it is far more elemental than that, grasping and clawing and growling in the dark, like some kind of swamp beast. The same goes for schools, corporations, and governments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are different species of these creatures. Decades ago, Richard Dawkins coined the term &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme"&gt;memes&lt;/a&gt; to identify creatures which exist as virulent ideas, spreading themselves from one brain to another, reproducing via our need to converse with other human beings. The birth of the internet meant that these creatures suddenly had an entire new world to colonize. And colonize it they did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Wink"&gt;Walter Wink&lt;/a&gt; has argued that it is best to view mobs, political systems, and institutions as “powers” which have possessed groups of people. The ancient world was ahead of us in this respect, intuitively naming and categorizing the varieties of different “powers” that existed. What we've dismissed as mythology was to them quite sober sociology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://kk.org"&gt;Kevin Kelly&lt;/a&gt; has even identified an entire “seventh kingdom of life”, whose genes are our ideas, and whose bodies are our tools. He calls this the “technium”, and includes in it the vast stretch of everything that humanity has created, from culture to science to technology to art.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cities too should be thought of as living beings. They inhale, they exhale, they consume energy and expel waste. They &lt;em&gt;breath&lt;/em&gt;. They are self-sustaining, repairing themselves when things go wrong, sometimes suffering disease, sometimes suffering the effects of age. We might tend to attribute all of this to city government, but governments really have only a small role to play in the actual lives of such creatures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These city-creatures are largely immobile. They are a species which latch onto good water supplies or mineral reserves, and dig themselves in deep. They generally expand over time, but rarely migrate in any significant way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Religions might be thought of as city-creatures which developed the ability to move. They immediately began to spread out, finding new types of resources and strongholds. Their offspring, social movements, upped the pace even more, democracy in particular having a quite rapid spread across the globe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;None of this should surprise us. Every other biological species on earth creates ecological niches, which other creatures rush in to fill. Why should we be any different? Our existence as the types of creatures we are has opened the door for all kinds of new beings, parasites, and &lt;em&gt;multi-cellular organisms&lt;/em&gt; to arise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They are neither intrinsically for us or against us. They just &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt;, and they are now an inescapable part of our life on this planet.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2005/08/26/apartment-returns/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2005/08/26/apartment-returns/</link><pubDate>Fri Aug 26 12:10:00 CDT 2005</pubDate><title>apartment returns</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>I've finally figured out my apartment difficulties, and I didn't even have to try.

This doesn't mean I won't read productivity blogs, and tweak things, and manage my "system". It means I no longer think about any of that stuff as having anything to do with productivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Productivity is what happens when you're doing work.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Enhancing your productivity is what happens when you do a lot of work, for long enough to get better at it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Look, throw all your stuff in &lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/tools"&gt;Dropbox&lt;/a&gt;, live your life out of &lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/protocols"&gt;plain text files&lt;/a&gt;, use gmail to communicate, turn off tasks and chat, leave things in their default settings as much as possible...but then figure out what it is that you really care about. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can't tweak your way to productivity, and there is no system to enhance yourself to superstardom. You just have to work. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But I'm not trying to be the "just do work" guy. Go ahead, tweak all you want. Enjoy it. Enjoy moving things around and labeling them in different ways. Just don't think of it as productivity, because it's not. And the pursuit of productivity is a distraction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don't be productive. Don't work on productivity. Just find something you enjoy, and do that. And if you tweak, enjoy tweaking. &lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2008/10/16/the-new-mystics/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2008/10/16/the-new-mystics/</link><pubDate>Thu Oct 16 16:52:00 CDT 2008</pubDate><title>The New Mystics</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>I am currently reading The New Mystics, by John Crowder - the guy who wants to "toke God".

As has been mentioned by others, the primary feeling one has in reading this book is cognitive dissonance. How can he write this well?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He does write well, and compellingly. One of his thoughts struck me hard, and I wanted to see what others thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He suggests "suicide preachers". As in, other people send Suicide Bombers to blow us up, we send Suicide Preachers to show them something better. Instead of watching a lone individual explode, destroying those around him, we'd see hundreds of people "imploding" on a lone preacher, destroying him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The concept is mind-shaking. Particularly when he goes on to suggest these "suicide preachers" would come from the ranks of the young men with few connections, and little to lose. The mentality is the same as that of the suicide bombers, only to reverse ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The idea is not that far from scriptural. Jesus and the early disciples purposefully put themselves into "suicidal" situations in order to proclaim the message of Jesus even louder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What do you think?&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2006/11/24/the-countdown-has-begun/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2006/11/24/the-countdown-has-begun/</link><pubDate>Fri Nov 24 16:31:00 CST 2006</pubDate><title>The Countdown has Begun...</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>Folks, we are busy gearing up for the March 9th, 2007 concert at the Charleston Civic Center.

&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've been a vegetarian for just about a decade. The other day, I decided to stop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around ten years ago, a constellation of experiences and feelings and philosophical ideas led me to becoming vegetarian. It had almost nothing to do with ideas about animal cruelty, and almost everything to do with the concepts of purity, of lightness of being, and of the historical precedent of revolutionaries throughout history. It was fundamentally a way to pursue being a different kind of human.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I learned a lot from vegetarianism. It practically forced me to try new fruits and vegetables, and to expand my palate far beyond what it had been before. I learned I could eat almost anywhere; I learned that having a lot of options wasn't really important. It probably led me to trying new restaurants, where an omnivore could have simply tried new menu items.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But I had another philosophical commitment as well: I never wanted to limit my ability to choose. Giving up choice has always seemed to me to be the beginning of everything wrong and bitter in the world. And irrational commitments were the top offender.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's always struck me just how many people make broad declarations, and then feel compelled to follow those declarations far beyond the point they should have given them up. When my parents swore they would never use AOL again, I chastised them for exactly that reason; do you really want to swear off something for all eternity?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The AOL thing may not have had any negative repercussions, but to me, the principle remained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So when I decided to be vegetarian, I simply decided to stop eating meat. I didn't decide to make a &lt;em&gt;commitment&lt;/em&gt; to not eating meat. My test statement was this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;If I ever wake up wanting to eat meat, I will do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I knew that if that statement ever became a lie, I would have gone too far. But that statement never became a lie for me. I never actually wanted to eat meat. Maybe a little bacon every now and then, but if I felt like it, I felt free to eat it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In over a decade, I think the only meat I ate consisted of some strips of bacon, and a pinch or two of various things my relatives asked me to try.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I never wanted it, and so my decision never became a constraint. But the other day, two things became apparent to me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had been listening to &lt;a href="http://5by5.tv/b2w"&gt;"Back To Work"&lt;/a&gt;, with Merlin Mann and Dan Benjamin. And Dan, who is a Buddhist, had been talking about how many, &lt;em&gt;but not all&lt;/em&gt;, Buddhists choose to be vegetarian. It made sense, he argued, that Buddhists would typically be the kinds of people interested in reducing suffering, and so would gravitate towards vegetarianism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, it so happens that Dan is really into paleo. So, while he's talking about this, it strikes me how deeply he's aware of the suffering that killing animals causes. And it strikes me even more, that he believes that humans need to eat animals to survive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So while he's talking about animal suffering, the subtext is his belief that humanity is not a species capable of &lt;em&gt;pure choices&lt;/em&gt;. Every decision we make implies some suffering, somewhere. Our very existence requires death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He, being a Buddhist, regrets this, but is able to deal with it as simply a fact about reality. This is a very different idea than the pursuit of purity I had embarked on. And although I'm not sure how I feel about it yet, the existence of this entirely different concept was my first realization. And it led to my second realization:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had learned all I could learn from being vegetarian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It would be easy for me to go for another decade without eating meat. I wouldn't feel like I was lacking in any way. But nothing significantly would change, and I would gain no new insight. In contrast, an excursion into an entirely new way of eating holds all kinds of realizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's tough, too. Most meat seems very gross, and even bacon isn't as appealing as it first seems. I'm very wary of what's &lt;em&gt;inside&lt;/em&gt; things. I have no idea how there's any sort of quality control. In addition, all kinds of people who've been inexplicably offended by my dietary habits are probably waiting to crow in triumph over what undoubtably seems like a victory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But those things are just things, and point to the fact that there may be a lot for me to learn here. And it would do far more damage to my sense of purity, if I ever let pride or fear significantly constrain my decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So the other night, I ate salmon for the first time as an adult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm aware that this is running in the opposite direction of many people I know. Many of them are just becoming aware of vegetarianism, and are considering it as a lifestyle change. It might be cooler for me to point out that I was an early adopter, and try to use that to increase my leadership points. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, some people who admired my vegetarianism might be disappointed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But I make decisions for myself, and I hope that those decisions always lean towards the bold, the risky, the experimental, and the uncharacteristic. To &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; do that, would be to become less of a human being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So here I am, eating chicken, exploring new worlds.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/how-salvation-works-in-christianity/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/how-salvation-works-in-christianity/</link><pubDate>Thu Aug 31 16:20:49 CDT 2017</pubDate><title>How does Salvation Work?</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>Here’s how salvation works in Christianity.

When Jesus is asked [how to inherit eternal life](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+10:25-28&amp;version=N...</description><content:encoded>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Here’s how salvation works in Christianity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Christianity, love is what saves. When Jesus is asked &lt;a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+10:25-28&amp;version=NIV"&gt;how to inherit eternal life&lt;/a&gt;, the answer is the &lt;em&gt;the greatest commands&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind, and, Love your neighbor as yourself.” (Luke 10:27)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Do this and you will live”, Jesus affirms. According to him, this is the summation of the &lt;a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+22%3A37-40"&gt;Law and the Prophets&lt;/a&gt;, and the thing that &lt;a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+5:44-48"&gt;makes one a child of God&lt;/a&gt;. It is all that has ever really been required. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But love is far harder than it seems. To love everyone—to embrace God’s concerns as one’s own—in the face of intense fear and violence and pain, is almost impossible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This impossibility is what we see on the cross. Intense love persisting in spite of everything against it. Intense love persisting in spite of pain, fear, violence, and injustice. Intense love still concerned for those around it, still loving its enemies, still refusing to give in to hate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To love like &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; requires faith.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is why Paul can constantly talk about salvation by faith, despite insisting that love is the most important thing of all. Faith is what enables us to love, in spite of everything that tells us love is foolishness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Faith is often expressed in concrete action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The faith of Abraham was the willingness to leave his home and venture into the wilderness, in pursuit of God’s promises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The faith of the Israelites was the willingness to cross the Red Sea, and leave their lives in Egypt behind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The faith of the early Christians was the choice to embrace a crucified Messiah, and publicly identify with him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reason these concrete actions are important is that once we declare something, it tends to get heavily reinforced over time. To cross the Red Sea meant you were all in—there was no going back to Egypt. To identify with a crucified Messiah meant there was no going back to your old social life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These kinds of concrete actions and declarations are how we establish our faith, our commitment to a certain path and a certain future. Having gone all in, we are able to do things we wouldn’t otherwise, we are drawn in certain directions, and immune to certain kinds of persuasion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the first century, this was played out in a concrete and dramatic way, as Jewish Christians remained immune to the nationalistic fervor that overtook the nation of Israel, leading to its horrifying destruction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Christians were saved from that destruction by faith, as lived out in their public identification with a Messiah who warned against just such a path.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps this is what Peter had in mind when he evoked the story of Noah’s flood—the New Testament’s most pervasive metaphor for salvation. Noah was saved by choosing to build the ark, and then letting himself be sealed inside it, sealing his fate both figuratively and literally. Once the ark was closed, there was no going back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This, Peter says,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“…symbolizes baptism, that now saves you…not the removal of dirt from the body, but the pledge of a clear conscience toward God.” (1 Peter 3:21)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Peter explains, baptism did not save by doing something to the body, but by doing something to the mind. By pledging themselves to God in a public way, they were cutting themselves off from the life they knew, sealing themselves to a fate that could lead in only one direction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was an extreme and concrete expression of faith. If Jesus was wrong, they were history’s greatest fools—if Jesus was right, they would be history’s greatest victors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But once the decision was irrevocably made, their resolve and their commitment to that direction would become stronger and stronger over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then, in the moment of greatest tribulation, they would be able to stand their ground, hold on to their faith, and love like God himself loved.

This initially seems much better, since it says we have the ability to have a relationship with God here and now. But ultimately, this approach renounces the world as well. Since God is experienced under the exceptional circumstances of a worship service, a distinction is maintained between normal life, and life in connection with God. God is sequestered into a building and an event, not because this is the intent of the organizers, but because the very structure of what they are doing demands it. Someone who has a brief experience of God may well be drawn into an addictive pursuit of more and more extreme worship experiences, trying ever harder to create a "thin space" where God may be felt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a simple calculation everyone intuitively understands. If God is experienced more in the service, then he is experienced less elsewhere. If powerful musical and inspirational performers, or special smells and ceremonies, or certain habits and locations, are the means by which God is brought close, then God is forever on the retreat from the world at large. The rest of life is less significant, and less meaningful. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It would seem then that there is no answer. God is either forever distant, incapable of being experienced at all, or our very attempts to experience him drain life of meaning. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Christianity has a different answer altogether. God is not experienced in moments of exultation, in ceremonies, or far removed from the world. God is experienced only and entirely in acts of love towards others. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the way in which Christianity turns us towards the world, to radically re-engage in life as it is. In Christianity, there is no service to God outside of service to others, there is no spiritual experience outside of practiced love. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is why Jesus makes a big deal about bread and wine at the last supper. Not because he wants them to have a ritual where they feel intense emotions as they exchange crackers, but because he wants them to pursue him in the living out of relationships, in the sharing of meals as the concrete expression of friendship and love.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/05/25/itinerary/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/05/25/itinerary/</link><pubDate>Fri May 25 06:47:12 CDT 2012</pubDate><title>Itinerary</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>I'm in the middle of a 40-day, 16 stop, 14 country tour of the world.

But they are separate things, and I embrace each of them for different reasons. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I embrace Christianity because I am incredibly drawn to Jesus of Nazareth, and his unique outlook on the world. I love the scriptures because he did, and because he shows us where the beauty lies in them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But I am a theist because I believe in humanity. I believe in possibility, in open-ended potential, in flourishing and learning and growing. And for me, there is no way to believe in these things without being a theist. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know this goes against many people’s intuitions. A lot of people see theism as a way to assert a closed universe, a hard set of limits around human behavior, and a limited imagination. This is the unfortunate legacy of much of medieval-tinged religion. But the truth is much different, and it doesn’t take a lot of thought to see why. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are only two possibilities: either reality is limited, or reality is unlimited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If reality is unlimited, then theism is true. Other beings are out there, other forces larger than we are, living immense lives on incredible scales. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And this would mean that hope is real. If there is no upper limit on reality, then human society can grow and flourish without fearing that one day we will hit a insurmountable wall. Every obstacle we encounter, we can come to with the knowledge that there is something beyond it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what about the other possibility?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think about what it actually means to be an atheist. An atheist may embrace their viewpoint for many commendable reasons. Maybe they value science, rationality, free thought — maybe they simply don’t see any evidence, or haven’t been convinced that anything larger exists. But if they actually hold to atheism as an assertion about reality, then they are asserting that reality is limited, capped at a certain level, and that nothing else exists beyond that. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consider Richard Dawkins. Most people identify him as one of the “new atheists”, but I count him as a fellow theist. He believes that there are superhuman beings, living immense lives, at levels far beyond our current imaginings. He even suspects that we might be in a universe created by one of these beings[^1]. For historical reasons, he doesn’t like to call these beings “gods”, but they &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; gods by every definition worth having. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why does he believe in these creatures? Because he thinks life isn’t limited to what we know on this planet. Reality is big, and the bigger it is, the more we have to consider the existence of entities larger than us. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be a true atheist then, one would have to believe in a universe smaller than that of Richard Dawkins. One would have to believe that the universe is bounded, not just in light-years, but in possibility. One would have to look at our expanding, twenty-billion-light-year-wide universe, and conclude that not only is this the limit of everything that exists, but that within all this immense reality, there is not a single being more powerful than the one reading this blog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Atheism must hold to a very limited existence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The great atheists knew this, and recognized the consequences. Bertrand Russell believed that the universe was limited, and that this meant that everything in reality would eventually die. The stars would be snuffed out, the universe would become cold, all matter would ultimately decay into nothingness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This meant, he said, that all human life must be built on despair, that everything we care about must vanish, that existence itself is futility. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was right. Death is the inevitable end of a closed system. If reality is limited, then there is nothing left but despair. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if reality is not limited, but is in fact unending, then there is hope. The world doesn’t have to die, the things we love about life do not have to vanish forever. If we do not live in a closed system, there is no reason for despair. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m not saying any of this to disparage atheism or atheists. I admire the courageous stance of Bertrand Russell, Isaac Asimov, and many others who stood against tradition and irrationality, and created meaningful lives in what they saw as a brutal universe. I admire someone who can face difficult truths and not shrink from them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But our universe is bigger than the universe they knew about. And every year, it gets a little bigger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are only two possibilities. Either reality is limited, or reality is unlimited. So far, every time humans thought they had found the limits of reality, they were wrong. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My guess is they always will be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[^1]: See &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=yq1xDpicghkC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=the%20god%20delusion&amp;pg=PA98#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false"&gt;this excerpt&lt;/a&gt; from his book.

God and the world and heaven and earth and you and me are all one blur, and all our dividing lines are illusions to be wiped away with a warm washcloth. As John Lennon sang, &lt;em&gt;I am the eggman, they are the eggmen, goo goo g' joob&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a favorite in progressive spirituality, and it has a lot going for it. It seems to provide us with a basis for love right down at the root level of existence. It also has a ready-made type of salvation: simply wake up to the illusion you’re living in. Simply wipe away the lines between you and the rest of existence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its answer to the problem of evil is also simple. Pain and suffering and so on are simply inescapable things, and it’s up to you to adjust yourself to them. You need to learn to see past these problems, and embrace the world as it is. And since God is one with the world, and these problems still exist, they must actually not be bad things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The second way is &lt;em&gt;dualism&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, and it holds that God and the world are poles apart. In some forms of the idea, this separation is even due to human sin — we’re so evil, God has to stay a universe away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a favorite in conservative spirituality, and it’s compelling for a couple of reasons. It seems to provide us with a natural framework: the world is bad, God is good, and &lt;em&gt;whatever is least like the world&lt;/em&gt; is what we should pursue. For some people, that means cultivating the mind instead of the body. For others, it means practicing religion instead of engaging with culture. For still others, it means actively rejecting any truth claims but one’s own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Salvation in this framework can mean escapist visions, like the &lt;em&gt;Left Behind&lt;/em&gt; series, where a select few people are snatched up to heaven, and the rest of the world gets to burn. Or it can mean simple negation, where people feel that their body is a cage, and they are just waiting to escape it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its answer to the problem of evil is likewise simple: God is letting this place go to hell, and you shouldn’t expect any different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The third way is less known&lt;/strong&gt;. We might call it &lt;em&gt;conversion&lt;/em&gt;, because it holds that heaven and earth are in the process of coming together. This, to my mind, is the worldview of great Christian writers like CS Lewis, NT Wright, JRR Tolkien, and GK Chesterton. In this view, and really only in this view, time and history play an important role. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, it is not simply that God is good and we are bad; rather, God is good, and we are in the process of being conformed to his image. Nor is it simply that heaven is great and earth is hell; rather, heaven is filled with the glory of God, and the earth is coming to progressively reflect that glory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This seems to be what Jesus had in mind when he prayed: “Your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Salvation in this framework isn’t escapism, it’s &lt;em&gt;resurrection&lt;/em&gt;. It is life fighting back against death, it is the light overcoming the darkness. It is transformation in the present, and the promise of ongoing and ever more dramatic transformation in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And here, the answer to the &lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/2013/01/01/problem-evil-problem-humanity"&gt;problem of evil&lt;/a&gt; is pragmatic instead of theological. Instead of telling us why things are often so bad, it insists that we must work to make them better. And it assures us that God himself is doing the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my mind, the first view is compelling, but ultimately demoralizing. If you want to make the world better, you must be sure not to want it too hard, because striving too much against the way things are is a moral failure on your part, a giving in to the great illusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the second view has a lot to offer, but &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; serves to destroy your motivation for doing good. If this place is going to burn, why bother making it better? Why bother improving the schools or the libraries or the parks? Why bother starting a business or working for a good cause? If all of this is horrific anyway, why waste the effort? Why not (to put a twist on Paul) just eat and drink, knowing that tomorrow all the good things we work for will die?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only in the third view can I see a way forward, a way to fully engage as a human being in making the world better. Here, we do not accept the world as it is, nor do we reject it as incapable of redemption. Instead, we recognize the good, God-given nature of everything, as well as his intense desire to reclaim what he has made. Here, we do not accept politics as usual, nor resign ourselves to the evils of existence. Here, we affirm our physicality, yet look forward to transformation. Here, we cherish the past, and yet are not chained to it. Here, we value the present, but do not &lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/01/04/peter-rollins-and-deception-living-moment"&gt;make it an idol&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we have a future. &lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2015/06/22/about-me/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2015/06/22/about-me/</link><pubDate>Mon Jun 22 18:04:51 CDT 2015</pubDate><title>About Me</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>I’m Micah Redding, a software developer, writer, and the co-founder and executive director of the Christian Transhumanist Association.

Maybe I won't know until I get there, maybe I'll only know in retrospect, that in that moment &lt;em&gt;I was&lt;/em&gt; and I &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; truly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But I think somehow it comes down to this, that I must have provocative conversations around campfires, and I must be on the move from moment to moment, touching down to light fires where I land. Above all, I must often wake up with no inkling of where I am.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am a runner, and something in me runs. My family has run for generations, not knowing what they were chasing, only knowing that because it was elusive, it must be chased. So I chase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But unlike my ancestors, I see some of the places the road goes. I realize the journey they were on, and the journey I am on, and I know it doesn't stop. We all run out of instinct, but I am beginning to know that instinct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And so dark nights and alley ways and rooftops and parties flash by. And starlit wilderness roads in pitch black, while buffalo surround you silently, and hard back seats of car rides where being squeezed into a small space is a welcome closeness to someone's skin, and windows looking out on tornados ripping Atlanta apart, and strangers offering to put you up for the night, and walking you to find food at 2am, and finally scaring you so much that you drive on through the desire to sleep, and kisses in bushes, and car-wrecks in the desert, and crying yourself to sleep on the floor of someone's doorway, and being so tired for once that you forget all sense of responsibility, and sleep, blessed sleep, in the cold, not sure where you are, unable to change one detail of your fate, while overhead the war rages on without you...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This must be what we are looking for. Our chase is never over, because we chase the chase itself. We are addicted to the smell of the hunt in our nostrils, the tingling rising up in our palms, and the compulsion that one more hill, one more turn, and we will finally be there, where things are perfect at last, where we've always wanted to be.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2007/04/11/computer-science-and-eternal-life/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2007/04/11/computer-science-and-eternal-life/</link><pubDate>Wed Apr 11 19:45:00 CDT 2007</pubDate><title>Computer Science and Eternal Life</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>Kevin posed an interesting question about post-mortem fate and eternal life.

Why are humans fascinated with this subject?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me answer by going as nerdy as I can, and approaching this question from the perspective of computer science.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In computer science, there are "finite state machines" and "infinite state machines"; two different types of computers or machines that can exist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finite State Machines must necessarily start repeating their actions at some point. They have a limited numbers of "states" they can be in, and after they reach that limit, they start doing the same thing over again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For example, if you left a desktop computer running for an infinite amount of time, it would have to start doing the same thing over and over again at some point. It does not have the capacity for new "states", or new experiences beyond a certain limit. It has a FINITE amount of states it can exist in. This is fundamentally because it has a limit to the amount of information it can address. Any given desktop computer has an upper limit to how much information it can deal with, no matter how much you upgrade it. At root, that computer is built to deal with only a certain amount of memory, and so it is a Finite State Machine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In its world, there is a certain amount of information that exists, and no more. Thus, there are a certain number of "thoughts" it can think, or things it can do, and no more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In philosophy, our universe has often been thought to be a Finite State Machine, such that everything that has been, will come again in exactly the same way. Jesus would die again on the cross, I would write this post again, etc. This is called "The Eternal Return".&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, there are Infinite State Machines, which have a literal infinity of different states they can exist in. If you give an Infinite State Machine the rest of infinity to do as it will, it doesn't EVER need to repeat a given "state". It can "think" new things, do new things, process new information, ad infinitum. It recognizes that there is an infinite amount of information out there, and so it is free to grow and process for the rest of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fundamental difference between a Finite State Machine and an Infinite State Machine is the amount of information it can address: Finite vs. Infinite. Because of this, a Finite State Machine will repeat given enough time, while an Infinite State Machine will never repeat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If Human Beings were Finite State Machines, it would be pointless to give them Eternal Life. They would simply start thinking and doing the same things over and over after a certain point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if Human Beings are Infinite State Machines, then they have the capacity to extend their memories and experiences indefinitely, limited only by their "hardware" (physical body). Given infinite time in which to live, a human would never have to repeat any past state, or relive the same moment. It could grow forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe that Human Beings are Infinite State Machines, and thus have the built-in capacity for Infinite Life. And if a being is able to take advantage of Infinite Life, I suspect that this being would realize it, and consider it a shame not to do so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is, I think, the fundamental basis for our fascination with Eternity.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2011/10/18/beginning-thought-writing-wiki/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2011/10/18/beginning-thought-writing-wiki/</link><pubDate>Tue Oct 18 12:11:20 CDT 2011</pubDate><title>The beginning of thought: Writing like a wiki?</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>In exploring the edges of my ability to write and explain myself cohesively, I've sometimes sketched out thoughts without full explanation or analysis or defense.

And I've been surprised to see those go farther than I would have thought possible. My recent article on &lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/2011/10/02/christianity-against-religion"&gt;Christianity against Religion&lt;/a&gt; is a good example. It occurs to me that this article is simply a jumping-off point for other discussions, and that if I do it correctly, I will discuss each point more in depth, returning to the original article to link forward to these more complete discussions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this begins to look more and more like a wiki. And wiki-writing seems appealing to me right now. Maybe rather than this forward motion of trying to lay out each thought completely in sequence, it would be better to begin iterating over ideas, digging deeper and deeper. Maybe this is a way to approach writing more in tune with the modern world. I don't know, but it's worth a try.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I will try. &lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/2011/10/18/beginning-thought"&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/crisis-orlando-nightclub-shooting/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/crisis-orlando-nightclub-shooting/</link><pubDate>Mon Jun 12 06:34:05 CDT 2017</pubDate><title>Crisis</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>*Today marks a year since the [Orlando nightclub shooting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Orlando_nightclub_shooting).

On June 12, 2016, a single gunman walked into a Florida nightclub and killed 49 people, wounding 58 others. A few days later, I wrote down some thoughts about what was happening. This is the first time I’ve shared them.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think we stand on the cusp of a crisis in the life of humanity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We see the leading indicators of it all around us. The intensifying clash between the West and the East, between Christians and Muslims, between the religious and the secular. We see the internal collapse of traditional Christianity among developed nations, coupled with the rise of radical Christianity in developing nations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much of this tension is driven by the fact that we now live in a global civilization. What happens on one side of the world immediately impacts the other side of the world. We are so tightly networked, that one person can affect almost everybody else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is both good and bad. Our global systems of communication can trigger the fall of dictators, or catalyze the rise of terrorist organizations. It is possible for vast efforts of cooperation to arise overnight, or for ISIS to recruit middle class American high-schoolers via social media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This past Sunday, a gunman massacred 49 people in a gay nightclub in Orlando, triggering a predictable, but chaotic national argument about gun control, Islam, and LGBTQ issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, most of that argument misses the point. This kind of violence is in part triggered by an increasingly connected and empowered world. The background tensions that caused this are going to continue to rise—and soon, assault rifles are going to pale in comparison to the destructive capabilities available to anyone, anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means that we are now in an arms-race between compassion and fear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people, on seeing the dangers being unleashed in the world, are doubling down on cries for protection, defense, security. This is the kind of environment in which fascism, based on the absolute priority of strength, begins to seem appealing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That way leads to utter destruction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If our response to rising tension is to become more aggressive, then our enemies will do the same. In fact, it is exactly this that is fueling the rise of ISIS. The more conflict there is between Muslim and non-Muslim cultures, the more appealing ISIS becomes to moderate individuals. Just as, conversely, the more conflict there is between Muslim and non-Muslim cultures, the more Americans cry out for blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The temptation here is to try to establish who deserves more of the blame. This is utter foolishness—a complete waste of time. While we are arguing about who deserves the blame, the world around us will descend into chaos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The solution is as obvious as it is counter-intuitive. We must fight the enemy by &lt;em&gt;removing his strength&lt;/em&gt;. We must perform a Judo move, using our enemy’s force against him. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the face of aggression, we must de-escalate. We must remove the impetus which fuels the enemy’s power. When caught between two societies of extreme aggression, humans will choose the side that looks most like them. But when caught between a society of acceptance and compassion on one side, and a society of violence and strength on the other—humans will choose the side of compassion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Incidentally, this is what Jesus means when he says, “Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good”. Rather than becoming more and more like the enemy, as you rise to meet his violence, become more and more &lt;em&gt;human&lt;/em&gt; in the face of that violence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is the most successful military strategy of all time. It led a small group of marginal Jews to defeat an empire. If it hadn’t worked, there wouldn’t be 2.5 billion Christians in the world today—there would be no Christians. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like I said, these tensions aren’t going to stop. And if all we do is respond to fear with more strength and aggression, then sooner or later a terrorist is going to get their hands on a weapon that will end life as we know it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The alternative is that we must exponentially increase our compassion. We must respond to fear with understanding. We must respond to violence with humanity. We must build a civilization more open, more resilient, more diverse, and more free than ever before. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Christians must welcome and embrace those with whom they intensely disagree—whether Muslims, LGBTQ, the non-religious, or whatever else someone may be. That is, after all, what living out Christian values is all about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The West must defend its values by actually embracing them—by creating a society of education and dialogue and diversity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Left and the Right must stop vilifying and demonizing each other, and must abandon the childish arguments that rise in the aftermath of crises and tragedies. They must either engage in civil dialogue, or disband in favor of some new social organization. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What the world needs is faith, hope, and love. Hope that a better future is possible, the faith to pursue it, and the love that will make it happen.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2005/05/30/different-things-go-in-different-directions/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2005/05/30/different-things-go-in-different-directions/</link><pubDate>Mon May 30 11:35:00 CDT 2005</pubDate><title>Different things go in different directions</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>We've got interesting stuff going on here behind the scenes.

The other day I tried street performing for the first time, and met some interesting people. I only stayed out there for a couple of minutes, but it was fun, and a good experience, I think. I also checked out a local venue in Nashville called &lt;a href="http://www.rcktwn.com/"&gt;Rocketown&lt;/a&gt;, which is AWESOME.

I'm guessing it does, however, and am continuing on that assumption.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the past few months, I haven't blogged, and wanted to start again, so I thought it fitting to describe briefly what I have been doing for that time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, I got married. Then, I undertook a long tour of college conventions and concerts across the country. Then, I picked up Facebook. Then, I began to consider how a person such as myself can facilitate a change of state in people's mentality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is what I have been considering and mulling over continuously for quite some time. My informal research has involved talking with hypnotists, public speakers, educators, and magicians, observing a wide variety of performances, reading interviews with Bono of U2, experimenting with Facebook, designing some web applications, engaging in a little bit of spoken word performance, and throwing a concert using some of my new ideas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sense that something is there to be uncovered. I feel like revolutions in people's thinking can and do happen. Right now, I'm thinking that what is needed is "truth".&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Truth is what changes people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But truth can't just be spoken. It has to be "realized". And that may involve stories, acting, movies, music, food, or experiences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I am looking to provide all of those things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-micah&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2011/09/16/language/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2011/09/16/language/</link><pubDate>Fri Sep 16 12:01:13 CDT 2011</pubDate><title>Language</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>I used to think that maybe we could find new words, and re-express Christianity in different language.

Christianity without the language of fall, redemption, and salvation is probably not Christianity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least, it's not recognizably Christian, and anyone who undertakes the task of this re-verbalizing will probably be doing it with such a slant, it will be unnatural and distorted. Christianity is what it is because its language is rich and deep and pervasive, fitting itself to new situations and new peoples over and over and over again. It has worn itself into deep poetry over the millennia, and will continue to do so for as far as we can see.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2006/11/27/generate-your-own-warning-label/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2006/11/27/generate-your-own-warning-label/</link><pubDate>Mon Nov 27 22:13:00 CST 2006</pubDate><title>Generate Your Own Warning Label</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>Who could pass up the chance to create their own warning label?

I mean, I don't want to overstate things here. I don't want you to hear something I'm not saying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth..."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"God" in this verse is the Hebrew word "elohim", a word which simply means "The Power". To put it into our vernacular, we might even casually suggest "The Force".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In the beginning, the Force, the Power, created the universe..."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the perspective of the Hebrew bible, the term "The Power" doesn't tell us much of anything. Instead, we have to read the story, have to engage with it, in order to gradually come to understand the character and nature of this force.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is the same way for me. "God" or "The Power" doesn't define much. In fact, it gives us nothing to believe in &lt;i&gt;or&lt;/i&gt; disbelieve in. It simply is. Everyone from skeptics to atheists to agnostics can acknowledge that our existence is the product of forces beyond us. A powerful force, or set of forces, created all that we see.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My aim, then, is not to prove or disprove the existence of a being or a force, but to explore what the nature of reality really is. What is the nature of the forces that brought us into existence?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Science shows us the way to begin answering those questions. And here's what I get from surveying the broad scope of popular science concepts:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1) The force is vast and immense, deeper than our wildest imagination.&lt;br/&gt;2) The force is powerful and creative, generating billions of galaxies of gigantic stars, rolling through many dimensions, across eons of time and multitudes of universes.&lt;br/&gt;3) The force created a universe fine-tuned for our existence to an incredible degree.&lt;br/&gt;4) The force, in an &lt;i&gt;extremely&lt;/i&gt; rare and improbable occurrence, created life.&lt;br/&gt;5) The force continues to push our universe towards ever-higher levels of complexity and order.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2007/10/02/trip-to-iowa-city/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2007/10/02/trip-to-iowa-city/</link><pubDate>Tue Oct 02 02:21:00 CDT 2007</pubDate><title>Trip to Iowa City</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>   We took a trip up to the fabulous land of Iowa City, Iowa for a big show.

The Marriot we stayed at had a very helpful sign to let us know not to drive up on the grass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On Friday, we decided to drive through Iowa City, exploring the wildlife, admiring the prarie, and picking up a big screen tv from the rental center. When looking for a parking spot, we accidentally parked right in front of a coffeeshop. Since there were &lt;em&gt;20 minutes&lt;/em&gt; (remember that number, it'll be important later) left on the parking meter, we decided to go in and partake of their offerings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shop was mysterious and Asian. Outside, it looked tiny - inside, it was huge. It was dimly lit, and smelled as if Hungarian poets made it their regular hang-out. We were in the middle of Iowa, smelling like Hungarian-Asian-magical-poetic coffee. What were we to think?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_RkQnU8sPjpM/RwGuteuPYDI/AAAAAAAAACI/TWTU9EKgkks/s1600-h/PICT0991.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;margin:0 auto 10px;" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_RkQnU8sPjpM/RwGuteuPYDI/AAAAAAAAACI/TWTU9EKgkks/s320/PICT0991.JPG" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;When our customized frozen drinks were delivered, instead of having lids, they were wrapped as if they were pre-packaged. We were amazed! How did they get those plasticized lids on there? We couldn't peal them off, we knew they weren't pre-made, and the straw went straight through. We could only conclude that they had some crazy magic cup-laminating machine in the back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, their magic machine was slow, and we didn't get out until &lt;em&gt;25 minutes&lt;/em&gt; (this is where that earlier number I told you to remember comes back into play) later - only to find our time expired and a ticket on our windshield.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_RkQnU8sPjpM/RwGu6uuPYEI/AAAAAAAAACQ/wMgYnzKoMfs/s1600-h/PICT0997.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;margin:0 auto 10px;" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_RkQnU8sPjpM/RwGu6uuPYEI/AAAAAAAAACQ/wMgYnzKoMfs/s320/PICT0997.JPG" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The police-folk of Iowa City are timely and prompt.

But long before that happens, the rising temperatures of the Sun will boil the oceans, and make the planet uninhabitable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every animal, plant, living creature, and microorganism will die. Every species will be driven to extinction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And all the life we know about in the universe—will perish. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists tell us that life has existed on this planet for approximately 3.5 billion years. This means that the natural history of life on this planet is more than 75% done. Mother Earth is in her waning years, three quarters of the way to total extinction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Mother Earth has produced one species capable of helping her avoid this fate—one species that can deflect killer asteroids, divert rogue comets, cool the atmosphere, and save the world. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That species is us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Humans don’t often realize it, but we play a unique role in the ecosystem. We are the only species capable of foreseeing long-term problems, and devising long-term solutions. We are the only species capable of foreseeing—and preventing—Mother Earth’s own ultimate demise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, we already have a plan for doing this. All we have to do is to land rockets on comets, give them a small nudge, and change their trajectories just enough so that over the next billion years, as they swing past the Earth thousands and thousands of times—they gently tug its orbit outward, keeping it perfectly balanced against the rising temperatures of the Sun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This plan no doubt has some downsides, and will need tweaked and updated over time. Perhaps we should replace it with a different plan altogether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The point is that, with only a few decades of even being aware of the problem, we’ve come up with a solution that is &lt;em&gt;already within our technological abilities&lt;/em&gt;. Who knows what we could come up with, given more resources, or another few hundreds or thousands of years?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, humans have been incredibly destructive. Scientists call our time period the &lt;em&gt;Anthropocene&lt;/em&gt;, the Earth’s sixth great extinction event. Our impact has been similar to the asteroid that killed the dinosaurs—leading many to wonder if the Earth would be better off without us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Primitivists&lt;/em&gt;, like the recently deceased Daniel Quinn, take this idea seriously—arguing that the only way forward for humanity is to revert to a pre-agricultural lifestyle, doing away with our technology, and returning to live as just another creature within the web of life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This would, they admit, require the death of billions of people. Pre-agricultural lifestyles can’t support seven billion people on this planet, and would actually create more environmental destruction than we produce now. So the only reasonable Primitivist plan requires massive forced sterilization, or dramatically reducing the human population in less savory ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if we achieved this, what would happen then?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An abandoned technological civilization doesn’t just disappear overnight. Who can imagine the vast waves of environmental catastrophe unleashed, as nature overtakes our cities, our oil refineries, our nuclear reactors? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How much fresh new environmental destruction would fall out from a world after people?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then, how long would it take for the world to recover? How long would it take for the ecosystem to rebound, for biodiversity to be replenished, for the impact of our fossil fuel extraction to be rectified?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To a rough approximation, it looks like the Earth might just be able to recover in time for the Sun to put an end to the whole business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But perhaps another intelligent species could rise up and do a better job? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not so, says astronomer Sir Frederick Hoyle, the man who coined the term “Big Bang”:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has often been said that, if the human species fails to make a go of it here on the Earth, some other species will take over the running. In the sense of developing intelligence this is not correct. We have or soon will have, exhausted the necessary physical prerequisites so far as this planet is concerned. With coal gone, oil gone, high-grade metallic ores gone, no species however competent can make the long climb from primitive conditions to high-level technology. This is a one-shot affair. If we fail, this planetary system fails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Primitivists make a compelling case, and their critique of human technological civilization should be taken seriously. But Primitivism cannot save the Earth from its fate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we want the Earth to survive and flourish, it looks like we are its only hope. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have caused untold damage, and unleashed vast destruction. But the good news is that if we stick around, we can not only reverse the damage we’ve caused, we can help life thrive like never before. We can resurrect extinct species, and restore long-gone ecosystems. We can raise whales, bison, and large predators to their former glory and far beyond. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can help life flourish at levels never before seen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in order for us to make that happen, we’re going to have to stick around for the next billion years. We’re going to have to keep developing our technological abilities, and extending our technological reach. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re going to have to become transhumanists. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we could ask Mother Earth what she thought about all this, perhaps she would express regret at the destruction that has been caused. But perhaps she would also say that this is exactly why we came into existence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps she would say that humanity was a risky proposition—but that the prospect of avoiding inevitable extinction was worth the risk. Perhaps she would say that out of all the possibilities, she chose us, because she wanted to &lt;em&gt;live&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/02/09/skulls-bones-and-power-law/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/02/09/skulls-bones-and-power-law/</link><pubDate>Thu Feb 09 10:31:13 CST 2012</pubDate><title>The Skulls, Bones and The Power of Law</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>[The Skulls](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0192614/) is a fictitious movie based on Yale's notorious secret *Skull and Bones* society.

It follows the path of a new initiate through the process of getting picked, going to clandestine meetings, engaging in rituals and tests of dedication, until finally being ushered into membership, complete with all its lucrative privileges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the process, however, something goes wrong. Someone gets killed inside the secret war-room, a complete cover-up ensues, and the main character is faced with an impossible dilemma. When he finally decides he won't go along with the secret crime, he becomes an enemy to the society, and they begin to hunt him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As they head towards the ultimate confrontation, he pulls out the club's rulebook, and demands a duel under their own code. If he wins, they have to let him go. If he loses, he is dead. Club rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I first watched that, I kept wondering why they didn't just kill him. They, after all, held all the power. Why &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; just go ahead and shoot him? Who was forcing them to go along with the code, even when it was being used against them?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In retrospect, the answer is obvious. The leaders of the society benefit profoundly from the society's existence. Its existence as a strong and united organization is predicated on the strength of their common rulebook. Without that rulebook, the society would fracture along all kinds of interests and loyalties. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And so the leaders must sacrifice to maintain the rulebook's strength. They must bind themselves unswervingly to its code, because once they no longer do so, the book loses its hold over the society, and it becomes worthless as a tool of control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's a powerful truth here. Laws aren't free. Someone buys their power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;~ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Proponents of gold-backed currency are fond of suggesting that paper money has no value whatsoever, that it really only holds imaginary worth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that's not quite true. When America went off the gold standard in the 70s, the value of the dollar plummeted, but it didn't bottom out. It was adjusting to its new basis of value - the machinations and gullibility of the American people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A simplistic way to think of this is to imagine that all that gold, sitting there for decades, could have been earning interest. If someone had taken it to the bank, it would have produced solid returns year after year, compounded until it doubled, tripled, quadrupled the original amount. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, that potential interest was poured into growing the value of the dollar, until the original gold was removed, and the interest itself was able to carry the weight of the dollar's value. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is an analogy. The real location of that "interest" was in the trust that politicians and government had painstakingly purchased, with their blood, sweat, and conspiracy. They bound themselves over to this system, in order to buy power for the system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;~ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are quite used to thinking of politicians as corrupt. We imagine that they break all kinds of laws, that they skirt the rules behind the scenes, engaging in closed-door negotiations and secret treaties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But even politicians are punished. When they are found out, when their friends and their allies are exposed, the penalties fly forth. And they submit. They sacrifice their friends and families if necessary, they let due process take its toll.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, they try to hide. They have numerous loopholes and excuses and exemptions. But this just reinforces the law itself: If the law exempts me, who am I to question it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By submitting themselves to the law, by enforcing it even on their companions, they are giving it power. They are feeding the machine, binding themselves to the system, buying it control. All of this so that the system can maintain its force and influence. All of this so that they may hope to exercise some of that control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So perhaps the real corruption is not in how they break the laws, but in how they keep them. &lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2007/01/03/the-second-album-part-4-completion/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2007/01/03/the-second-album-part-4-completion/</link><pubDate>Wed Jan 03 02:25:00 CST 2007</pubDate><title>The Second Album, Part 4: Completion</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>The day had come to record our drum tracks, the final touch to our album.

Some producers might consider that backwards, but up until then, we had been doing all of our recording for instruments and vocals in our small apartment studio — and generally speaking, neighbors just don't like it when you play drums next door. So we had put off recording the drums until very last, searching for an ideal location and time to get the tracks done in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a note here for those not familiar with the recording environment: we were using something called "overdubbing", where we recorded the bass to a basic click track (to keep us in rhythm), then went back and recorded the guitar over that, then the vocals, then the strings, then the leads, etc. Since we were doing all our own recording, engineering and production for most of our songs, we couldn't all play at the same time, in unison, like we do live. So we overdubbed tracks after the fact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One other notable delay involved here, was that until then — the same day that we were scheduled to record drums — the drum pickups hadn't been delivered. We had decided a few weeks back that we wanted to look at doing our recording with Pick Up the World© polymer film pickups instead of the standard drum microphone setup, because they were much lighter, more versatile, more transportable, and just plain cool. We'd seen other drummers using them, and just had to give them a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So they had just arrived at around 2:00 p.m. that afternoon, and we decided that our grandparents' empty house in Henderson (a town just northeast of Nashville) would be an ideal location to record in privacy without disturbing the neighbors, so we packed up and headed up there to get to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something we hadn't planned for was the fact that, due to the new technology we were using to capture the sound, it took a lot of tinkering and placement trial and error to get everything worked out where we could successfully sit down and record takes for each of our songs. It actually ended up taking all afternoon, evening, and part of the night to get the drums set up and ready to record, so that seriously delayed our project. Micah and I crashed at around 11:00 p.m., but Gabe stayed up till around 5:00 or 6:00 a.m. getting the tracks set up and testing the drum sounds before he finally went to bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next day, Gabe got up late and got to work again, and we went through and recorded a minimum of 2 takes for each of the songs. It might have taken a long time, but by the time we finished, we were heading back to the house with a full album's worth of quality drum recordings ready to mix in with the rest of the tracks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The final steps toward completing our album were editing, mixing, and mastering. So Gabe began the process of going through each track of each song, choosing which take we liked best, and chopping it to where it needed to be, etc. We got through 10 of our 12 songs and realized we had forgotten something: The vocals for Anger were nowhere to be found.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the last minute, we had to organize an emergency recording session, set up mics, clear the floor, and one by one we came in and recorded lead vocals, tenor, and alto, respectively. Luckily, we finished with no significant delays, so we closed out the session and edited the new vocal tracks down to size, and dubbed them into the song.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mixing consisted of setting automation for the faders, adding small amounts of reverb to the vocals, adjusting EQ, etc. As our resident audiophile, this was Gabe's favorite part of the whole process. This was also the slowest, longest part of the whole process, and between planning for our big concert at the Charleston Civic Center, playing live shows in Nashville, and holding down day-to-day responsibilities, it took us nearly 3 weeks just to complete the mixing. But in the end we were happy with how it turned out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on the overwhelming response from our readers last month, we asked Bug Lilly, a local Charleston folk singer/songwriter, to open our show for us on March 9th, and he agreed.

From theologians and philosophers, to environmentalists and activists, there is a lot of concern with how we think of ourselves, and our relationship with the physical world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Descartes"&gt;René Descartes&lt;/a&gt; is often credited with (blamed for) sending Western culture down the road of Cartesian Dualism. In Cartesian Dualism, there is the &lt;em&gt;mind&lt;/em&gt; and there is the &lt;em&gt;body&lt;/em&gt;, and only ever-so-slightly shall they meet. In this worldview, we are essentially floating heads, trapped in physical bodies. The mind, the intellect, and the spirit &lt;em&gt;matter&lt;/em&gt; — the body, the emotions, and the digestive tract do not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it’s not just Western scientists and logicians who hold this viewpoint. It’s also present in everything from blockbuster movies to new age spirituality. To use an expression popular in the new age movement, the question is &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;...whether we are physical beings having a spiritual experience, or spiritual beings having a physical experience…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;— and the answer is always the latter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are in the midst of a reaction against this view. The view itself has been blamed for everything from the current obesity epidemic, to the environmental crises facing various parts of the world. If we think of ourselves primarily as minds, then why bother taking care of our bodies, and why bother taking care of the world?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In theology, the tide has been turning as well. Increasingly, theologians are intent on saying that we are not just minds or spirits, seeking some kind of enlightened escape to a nether world, but bodies and organisms, seeking transformation in this world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This turn has not been driven by some kind of intellectual fad, but by the logic of the disciplines themselves, by the resurgence of historical research, and the renewal of interest in ancient Judaism — which saw human beings as holistic organisms, not as imprisoned minds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It goes without saying that the same kind of turn has been happening in science, which every day discovers new ways in which our brains are incredibly physical things, embodied in an incredibly physical world. The view that we are beings driven only by the conscious intellect is wearing increasingly thin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve been aware of this conversation since I was 13, and by the age of 15, had completely moved to the non-Cartesian side of the tracks. But the truth is always more complex than a dualistic conflict, and non-Cartesians should recognize that more than anyone. For the benefit of my Neo-Platonist friends, who feel slighted in this conversation, I may explore some of those complexities later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But for now, let me summarize what I think is so important about embodiment, and what I think Cartesians and Platonists miss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Embodiment means relationship. To be embodied is to be in relationship with both sentient and non-sentient things, to be forced to negotiate with both our friends and our hunger pains. To recognize our embodiment is to recognize the important of other entities, the significance of other concerns and other needs. It is fundamentally the embrace of negotiation, persuasion, and cooperation, instead of force and violence. It is the opposite of solipsism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whatever kinds of forms we may take in the future, whatever kinds of beings we may become, embodiment will always be important, because to be embodied is to relate to that which is outside ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2005/03/22/weekend-in-nashville/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2005/03/22/weekend-in-nashville/</link><pubDate>Tue Mar 22 21:44:00 CST 2005</pubDate><title>Weekend in Nashville</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>Well, we drove a lot this past week.

Micah went to Nashville on Tuesday night, and stayed with his friends there, looking around and "scoping out the scene". He went to a concert and saw &lt;a href="http://www.lunahalo.com"&gt;Luna Halo&lt;/a&gt; perform as well as Pale Blue Dot, a kind of country-rock-hippy band. Then on Friday, he drove back up to Lexington, and met Siah and Gabe (who were driving from WV). There we played with Zack Damron at &lt;a href="http://www.commongroundsoflexington.com/"&gt;Common Grounds&lt;/a&gt;, and met some interesting people. Then we all loaded back up and drove to Nashville, arriving there at 4am, and giving us all the opportunity to try Red Bull for the first time. Micah drank one that night, thinking it tasted nasty, but the next day, he gulped down another one. It must have altered his brain chemistry. Anyway, we spent all day Saturday looking around at big houses, and saw a bunch of weird ones. We went down Music Row, and saw all the tourist stuff, and everything. We almost did some street-performing, but had left our guitar behind accidentally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, that was our weekend. Now we're back. Micah randomly cut his hair when he was asleep.

That is, the hacking allowed is to openly access and read the rules of the simulation. Root access isn't given, nor universal eval functions (which is good, otherwise we'd overwrite everyone). It may be that we have to achieve something before being given access, or it may be that the ground rules are so open, we don't need higher access (ie, this is the rooted-ist set of physical laws which are coherent). Either way, evidence suggests we aren't intended, and won't be allowed, to hack out of it until something changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Originally posted:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/transfigurism/permalink/10152050657730436/?comment_id=10152051330265436&amp;offset=0&amp;total_comments=12"&gt;https://www.facebook.com/groups/transfigurism/permalink/10152050657730436/?comment_id=10152051330265436&amp;offset=0&amp;total_comments=12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2008/07/23/im-not-there-bob-dylan-and-the-spirit-2/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2008/07/23/im-not-there-bob-dylan-and-the-spirit-2/</link><pubDate>Wed Jul 23 08:33:00 CDT 2008</pubDate><title>I'm Not There: Bob Dylan and The Spirit</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>I first watched I'm Not There at the Belcourt Theater in Nashville.

It's a film based on the many lives of Bob Dylan, who is played by six different characters, including Kate Blanchett. It's not your average movie fare, to say the least. It sparked &lt;a href="/blog/2007/12/28/im-not-there-bob-dylan-and-the-spirit"&gt;several thoughts&lt;/a&gt; the first time I watched it. And on the flight back from Kuwait, I watched it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm not enough of a Dylan expert to feel qualified to evaluate the movie, but here is what it made me think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Chaos is Key&lt;/span&gt;. The universe exists on the edge of order and chaos. The artist is the one who travels farther over the edge than anyone else, and brings part of his experience back. The revolutionary is the one who brings the chaos back with him. When Bob Dylan went electric at the height of his folk popularity, he found a way to introduce chaos into his world. From listening to him, it seems that this was his intention. Chaos is both destructive and constructive: it tears down the forms of the old, so that something new and unexpected may result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;There is no "End"&lt;/span&gt;. We deceive ourselves into seeing ourselves heading towards a climax. Perhaps that is the only way we can see things; but once there, we discover that our climax was only a local maximum on the road of history. The movie (perhaps unwittingly) made this point through several false endings, both in the individual characters' lives, and in the movie as a whole. One character dodges a bullet and escapes to the hills, to live a reclusive life as a vanished legend. We've seen this story before; he goes out in a blaze of glory, but secretly he survives and vanishes into a cloud of dust. And his story is supposed to be over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But life is not a fairy tale, and no matter how much legend we've created for ourselves, life must go on, and our character (no matter how much he tells himself otherwise) will continue to adventure and travel and run from the law.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many in America saw their world coming to an end in the 1960s. Everything was falling out of whack: between hippies and war, assassinations and corruption, the world seemed like it was falling apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But life goes on, and so after the cultural apocalypse of the 60s and 70s, you have the 80s and 90s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Humans are so used to expecting an end. Living in a world &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;without end&lt;/span&gt; requires new ways of approaching life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jesus was an artist&lt;/b&gt;. The second time I watched the movie, I was struck by something that particularly hits home to me as a musician.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In one scene, the Bob Dylan character is fed up with the world, and goes out causing mayhem with poet Allen Ginsberg. In a park, they find a statue of Jesus on the cross, and begin hurling insults at it. But the insults are tinged with sarcasm: "Come down, boy, or you might get hurt up there!" and "Play your early stuff!"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="Ih2E3d"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unspoken truth is that they are not actually mocking Jesus; they are seeing themselves in his place. Just like them, Jesus was a radical who was often simultaneously lauded, rejected and misunderstood by his own people. Just like them, Jesus was an artist, a poet - and the public didn't always understand the demands of his art.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;The bane of the performing musician is the guy in the back of the audience who yells "Freebird!" It's a joke, a stereotype - but it's true - the audience doesn't want art, they want to hear what they know, what they've heard before. The audience doesn't want to hear The Rolling Stones playing their new songs; the crowds yell:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Play Satisfaction!"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Play your early stuff!"&lt;div class="Ih2E3d"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jesus found himself in this scenario again and again. He healed people, and people loved him. He fed people, and thousands followed him. "Multiply more loaves!", they would yell. "Play your early stuff!"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;But Jesus the artist wanted to move on. Jesus wanted to transcend what he had already created, what he had already done. He wanted to do things bigger and deeper and wider than he had done before. He had a bigger vision in mind. But the crowds didn't see it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jesus tells them that the real bread is his body, the real drink is his blood. And the people leave. "Why doesn't he just stick to the good stuff?", they probably asked. "We know what we want to see! Why this new teaching? Why these new songs? Why not some more food miracles?"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Play your early stuff!"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Art has its own desires. It desires to transcend what has come before, to move to a higher level, to draw the audience into a deeper engagement and understanding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And so art has a pain attached to it. Especially when your art is your love for all mankind.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2013/04/21/better-apocalypse/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2013/04/21/better-apocalypse/</link><pubDate>Sun Apr 21 23:57:10 CDT 2013</pubDate><title>A Better Apocalypse</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>On May 21, 2011, I was sitting in a steel-roofed building as a powerful storm pounded down outside.

And the next day came, and Harold Camping went back to his studies, and his followers went back to their homes and their jobs and their bills, and to trying to make sense of living in a world that stubbornly refused to quit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn’t the first time something like this has happened. The history of the West is in some ways the history of Christianity, and the history of Christianity, according to Albert Schweitzer, is the history of the &lt;em&gt;delay of the Parousia&lt;/em&gt;, the continual disappointment of apocalyptic hopes, the failure of apocalyptic expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over and over, charismatic prophets and preachers have led their people into the wilderness to await the end. And over and over, they have been disappointed and disillusioned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what’s remarkable about all of these prophesied apocalypses is how profoundly non-historical they are. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What I mean is that they do not arise from social, or economic, political, or ecological issues. They do not arise from human choice or action. They draw a firm line, and declare that here history ends, and something else begins, that here everything you’ve known and worked for gets discarded, and here, something else takes its place. The line is so firm that nothing carries over, nothing is preserved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s no surprise then, if those who have been influenced by this outlook, even when they didn’t leave their homes or jobs behind, have often found themselves losing interest in art, in science, in technology, in the ongoing struggle of the human race.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After all, if God doesn’t care about these things, why should we?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m convinced that this is a contributing factor to the growth of secularism in our world. If the most intensely religious people find themselves no longer interested in the life of the human race, then it will be the secular who will inherit the earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there is another form of apocalyptic outlook, one that draws from a much deeper source than that practiced by Harold Camping and those like him; one that grew organically from the worldview of the ancient Jews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Jews believed that their God was intimately involved in the created order, and as such, his attributes — things like truth, justice, and freedom — became the primary factors in human history. They were always rising, always advancing, always moving forward, like an incoming tide rising up on the shoreline of the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But they believed this could be resisted. Like a tide or a flood, you could build barricades and barriers and walls to hold the water back. Empires could arise, Emperors could come to power, to kill and enslave thousands and tens of thousands, to the point where their power seemed not only inevitable but unstoppable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the Jewish outlook said that this could not last forever. A time would come when the rising force and weight of justice would finally overwhelm the emperors and empires, sweeping over them and bringing them down with a mighty crash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was the apocalyptic moment, the turning point in history, and the more intensely the power structures had resisted the force of justice, the more cataclysmic would be their ultimate undoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They saw this happening in their primal narrative, the Exodus. The Jews had been slaves in Egypt, crying out for relief from their oppression, and Pharoah had set his entire might and power against them, to ensure that their cries for freedom and independence were not achieved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And for a while, the Jewish cause seemed hopeless, and futile, and foolish. But as the Exodus story tells it, even the power of the almighty Pharoah ultimately fell beneath the rising tide of freedom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This story became projected out on the world, the lens through which they saw the Babylonian Empire, the Roman Empire, and every other violent and brutal regime in history. The prophets would rise up, and use what the scholars call apocalyptic language — just as we use poetic language in our songs to highlight the dramatic significance of small romantic events, they used poetic language to highlight the incredible human significance of these moments in history. And so they spoke of the stars falling from the heavens, the sun refusing to give its light, the moon going dark, the rivers running red — calling back to the Exodus story, to the plagues on Egypt — to let their hearers know that although these empires seemed unstoppable, that ultimately this was just another Pharoah, just another Egypt, that would not have the final world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And so the Jews didn’t see one apocalypse at the end of history, but many scattered throughout it — everywhere that good and evil met in conflict, and good, sometimes through prolonged and painful struggle, succeeded, this was a moment when the truth broke through, when the nature of reality was revealed, freedom flowed forth, and the arc of the universe could be seen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And far from drawing them out of the world, this apocalyptic viewpoint drew them more deeply into it. If truth and justice and freedom were always rising, then one could have the courage to take a stand even when it seemed hopeless, (and tell the truth, even in a world of darkness), knowing that your efforts were never wasted, that your struggle was not in vain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But they also saw the profound significance of human action. Because history was not predestined, but was incredibly contingent — every crisis needed a small group of people to become a channel, a small hole in the wall, through which freedom and justice could begin to pour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And so, drawing from this powerful outlook on the world, the Jewish people stood for a level of human dignity and significance unprecedented in ancient times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this isn’t just something that happened in ancient history. It’s something that has had an impact much closer to home, in recent American history, in the person of Dr Martin Luther King jr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Martin Luther King grew up in an environment saturated with the language and viewpoint of the Jewish prophets. And so, when he began to envision and call into being a better future, he drew upon their words and their outlook to highlight the incredible significance of that moment in history, the importance of individuals choosing to stand on the side of freedom, and the profound consequences of ignoring the voices of the oppressed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The arc of the universe is long, but it bends towards justice&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;And far from drawing people out of the world with his prophecies of a better day, his words drew people more deeply into engagement with their world and their moment in history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As spiritually-oriented people, I think one of the most significant things we have to offer is a better way of looking at the future. And we have choices — choices in how we talk about it, choices in how we portray it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of those choices is an apocalyptic outlook that, throughout history, has led to disappointment and disillusionment and despair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another of those choices is an apocalyptic outlook that draws from the deepest parts of our religious heritage, and which for thousands of years, has inspired people to some of the most profound acts of honesty, courage, and love, the world has ever known.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://res.cloudinary.com/micahredding/image/upload/c_scale,w_650/v1453098936/apocalyptic_3_ullrlo.png" alt="The apocalypse should sound more like Martin Luther King, and less like Harold Camping" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

A few days ago, I delivered a talk entitled “A Better Apocalypse: Ancient Eschatology for a Transhuman World”. I gave this talk at the 2013 conference of the [Morman Transhumanist Association](http://transfigurism.org), a group which I have been incredibly fortunate to become friends with over the past two years.

I would love to discuss this topic more broadly. To invite that conversation, I am posting the link to the video, the audio for download (can be loaded on mp3 player or phone), and an edited transcript of the talk.

Thanks for continuing to be part of important conversations.

Her lyrics tear you apart line by line, only to build you back again with verse after verse of surgically precise digs and strokes. Raymond casually combines elements of soul and folk into something she playfully refers to as "soulk music" (which, afterall, sounds better than "foul music"). Whatever she calls it, it's not your average girl-with-a-guitar fare and deserves your undivided ear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.myspace.com/shelleyraymond"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.myspace.com/shelleyraymond"&gt;http://www.myspace.com/shelleyraymond&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rob Hawkins&lt;/b&gt; is a singer/songwriter that grew up as a well-travelled Air-Force brat before the age of five from Arizona to New Hampshire. Moving eventually from Ohio to Nashville he continues to ride the crossroads of music with his emotional voice, strong musicianship, and message driven songs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Shawn A Finson (Wee the People)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wee the People are a band; although, the name Wee the People refers less to a group of band mates and more to a group consciousness. It is a tribute to “the little people” or the commoners—those whose voice is rarely heard above the incessant drone of an ever present, growing, and looming noise machine. Wee the People use song to try and break through that ugliness. Sometimes we strive for harmony and other times we resort to dissonance, paying less homage to ideas about style than to the seminal ideas, which ultimately get stylized. Wee the People feel song is a great place to be idealistic, if not romantic. We are simply happy to have a voice, albeit small. We don’t claim to speak for everyone or even to make songs that appeal to the majority. We do, however, hope that our songs speak to someone. And we hope that someone joins in the conversation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.weethepeople.us/"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.weethepeople.us/"&gt;http://www.weethepeople.us/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Seth Harper&lt;/b&gt; is basically new to the Nashville music scene. Sprouting from deep Alabama roots, Seth looks to further a sort of Renaissance for his homeland, keeping his music wide-ranging but at the same time distinctly Southern in delivery. His voice is gritty, yet pleasant, and his songs are honest, yet oddly poetic. He tends to weave tales of weary souls, beautiful women, and second chances, all the while putting on an explicitly spiritual edge. He is still looking for just the right bandmates, but until then he will walk this road all by himself.&lt;br /&gt; ----&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Frank Salerno)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gentry Morris&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2006/11/27/do-we-need-hierarchies/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2006/11/27/do-we-need-hierarchies/</link><pubDate>Mon Nov 27 21:37:00 CST 2006</pubDate><title>Do We Need Hierarchies?</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>A guy named Sig talks about why we don't need hierarchies in companies, and a friend of his challenged him with a few objections...*  Hierarchies are the natural, programmed organizational model hard-...</description><content:encoded>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;A guy named &lt;a href="http://www.typepad.com/t/trackback/2380813"&gt;Sig talks about why we don't need hierarchies&lt;/a&gt; in companies, and a friend of his &lt;a href="http://www.undefined.com/cgi-bin/mt/mt-tb.cgi/159"&gt;challenged him with a few objections&lt;/a&gt;...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;* Hierarchies are the natural, programmed organizational model hard-wired into our brains.

I don't mean that the average person doesn't get what the theologians are telling them - I mean that the upshot of most of the discussion among theologians is confusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most popular understanding right now is that people sinned, God was justifiably mad, and the only way to deal with that madness was for God to vent his wrath on &lt;em&gt;someone&lt;/em&gt;. By virtue of Jesus' own sinlessness, he was able to take the wrath on himself, and balance God's ethical books. Now God is not mad anymore, or at least, not mad at any who agrees to take Jesus up on his offered exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think there are some problems with this picture, and I would venture to say that most theologians think so too. But if you've been taught that THIS is the gospel, pure and simple, let me point out that Christians didn't teach this story for hundreds of years after Jesus. A more popular story was called &lt;em&gt;Christus Victor&lt;/em&gt;, and pictured the cross as a deal between Jesus and Satan. Satan had lawful claim to the sinners of the world, Jesus offered himself in their place, and Satan agreed to the deal, not realizing that Jesus would rise from the dead almost as soon as Satan managed to destroy him. In this view, the cross is more of a sneaky trick, and God isn't the problem that Jesus had to solve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think this view is much closer to the biblical concept, but there are still some rough edges. CS Lewis claimed it was okay that we didn't completely understand what was happening on the cross - that we should expect to see many dimensions to what happened. And I think that is closest to the truth yet: Jesus was creative and brilliant, and each of his actions carried many many layers of meaning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is another problem. People seem to fall into two camps: those who focus on Jesus' life and teachings and actions, and those who focus on Jesus' death and its ontological significance. These two camps seem to be split between an emphasis on radical engagement with the world, and a focus on achieving salvation. With a focus on salvation, Jesus' death is often seen more as an eternal timeless thing, rather than a specific moment in history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, I saw another layer of the meaning of Jesus' death. And that layer is a seamless connection between Jesus' life and the cross.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Usually we look at the cross as sacrifice, but Jesus didn't sacrifice just to sacrifice. He sacrificed to &lt;em&gt;identify&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jesus was the burning, flaming presence of God, and his mission on earth was to carry that flame to the places it had never gone. From his birth in the backwaters of the Jewish countryside, to his emergence as a homeless wandering preacher, he was identifying with those on the outskirts of the godly world. From the rag-tag band he gathered around himself, to the gentiles he praised, he was pulling in different factions into his circle of light. From fraternizing with prostitutes and tax collectors, to touching the hands of lepers...he was bringing the presence of God to places it hadn't been seen. Every step he takes is as if he's saying, "God is here too."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his worldview, where he went, God went. And he was ready to go absolutely anywhere that God needed to be. Every time he touched someone, he must have seen himself carrying the presence of God to those outside the bounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not because he was bringing a rule-book they hadn't heard before. No, he was lifting the shadow of rejection and exclusion that hung over the people. He was pulling back the curtain, revealing the light that was ready to come pouring through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And so it is only natural that Jesus finally found himself walking towards the last place on earth that God would go - the summit of carcasses, where evil went to die and rot. "Outside the camp" in Jewish parlance, the place God did not recognize, the place where all others finally and completely turned their backs. The place of curses; and Jesus walked into it, willingly, daring us to look at him as the presence of God, descending into the place we cannot stomach him going, because we cannot stomach acknowledging it ourselves. Jesus purposefully went to the place that all heaven and earth said was outside God's sight, and once there, he fully and completely took on all the rejection and ugliness that it entailed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And in the darkness of rejection by God and all humanity, we are invited to see that God is there too, dying and vomiting with us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jesus' death wasn't to placate anybody. It was to make sure we saw the brutal truth that God is in everyplace, and that no barrier or darkness can separate us from him.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2011/12/09/peter-rollins-and-death-religion/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2011/12/09/peter-rollins-and-death-religion/</link><pubDate>Fri Dec 09 14:01:30 CST 2011</pubDate><title>Peter Rollins and the Death of Religion</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>I'm currently reading [Peter Rollins'](http://peterrollins.net/) brilliant and incisive book "Insurrection".

One of the primary ideas is that on the cross, Jesus lost everything &lt;em&gt;including God himself&lt;/em&gt;, and that this experience of the loss of God is the central dynamic at the heart of Christianity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is, any religious person can believe in God. But a Christian who has gone through the crucifixion experience, who has lost all faith and all trust in God, has really and truly experienced what Jesus experienced, the consuming truth behind Christianity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rollins is careful to point out that many people attest to struggles with faith, and aknowledge a place for doubt in the religious life. But most of these people have not &lt;em&gt;experienced&lt;/em&gt; that doubt and that loss, because their religious institutions provide them with safe places to express themselves, to deconstruct and reconstruct their faith.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people, I dare say, would suppose that is a good thing. But it is not the &lt;em&gt;Christian&lt;/em&gt; thing. It is not what Jesus experienced on the cross.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jesus, in contrast to the modern Christian struggling with doubts, had no recourse. He was naked and exposed to the world, rejected by his friends, his family, his country, his religion, and his God. There was nothing to protect him from pure existential horror.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Rollins, religious institutions are safety blankets, which allow us to have all the doubts we want, to even become atheists if we so desire, and yet experience nothing of the horror of those doubts. And to him, this prevents us from coming face to face with the real Christian experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Up to this point, I haven't questioned Rollins' analysis. We can discuss whether there are any issues with it later. But this is a good point at which to link up with another discussion I've been having, as to whether Christianity should be understood as the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/2011/10/02/christianity-against-religion"&gt;anti-religion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think Rollins would go with this designation. He contrasts the religious mindset as offering security, while the truly Christian mindset rips it away. I've used the term in a slightly different way: I think religion offers authority structures and ritual, while Christianity originally &lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/2011/10/02/christianity-against-religion"&gt;rejected both&lt;/a&gt; of those things. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast to the religious world around it, Christianity rejected temples of all kinds. It rejected religious teachers and leadership. It rejected rituals and rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rollins see religious institutions as posing a problem: they &lt;em&gt;believe&lt;/em&gt; on behalf of the one doubting, so that the doubter need not feel the true horror of that doubt. To fix this, he suggests that these institutions become institutions of doubt, where the worship leaders and the praise songs express the doubt, forcing the worshippers to confront it face-to-face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He himself started his religious career as part of &lt;em&gt;Ikon&lt;/em&gt;, a group that apparently does just that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think if anti-churches like this work, then that is great. But I am doubtful that religious institutions in general will reverse and do so. Even if they did, even if every expression of corporate life was a confrontation with doubt, I suspect that the nature of the structure itself would still provide the security blanket Rollins is trying to get away from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which is where I think Christianity's rejection of organized religion comes into play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first Christians didn't get together to sing songs of doubt and loss. They didn't sing laments about their dark nights of the soul. What they did was to tear away everything that provided comfort to one raised in a religious environment. They abandoned everything but Christ, and (horrifically) &lt;em&gt;him crucified&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They abandoned temples, synagogues, priests and religious intercessors. They abandoned teachers and benefactors and family. They abandoned rituals, ceremonies, and even &lt;em&gt;the law itself&lt;/em&gt;. There was no worship service, no organized religion, no concrete system of ethics, to fall back on or provide identity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can see the true horror this posed to the ancient world. &lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/2011/10/14/thought-baptism"&gt;Baptism&lt;/a&gt; was a death in a deep, deep sense, because with it, one not only abandoned "their old life", but truly everything they knew about life itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this I think that Christianity was the institutional expression of exactly what Peter Rollins is arguing for. Christ had lost everything including God himself, and similarly, the first Christians joined a religion which eliminated every system or structure or comfort that religion had ever provided.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/04/25/christianity-transhumanism/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/04/25/christianity-transhumanism/</link><pubDate>Wed Apr 25 09:34:42 CDT 2012</pubDate><title>Christianity is Transhumanism</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>Wesley J.

Fo...</description><content:encoded>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Wesley J. Smith has written a short piece entitled &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.firstthings.com/blogs/secondhandsmoke/2012/04/21/christian-transhumanist-is-an-oxymoron/"&gt;Christian Transhumanism is an Oxymoron&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those of you who are interested in either Christianity or transhumanism, I want to make this very clear:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Christianity &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; transhumanism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not just that they are compatible. Christianity is a distinctly transhumanist viewpoint that sprung up in the first century, and set out to reshape both the world and human nature. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to see that this is so, let me pull the most universally significant phrases from Wikipedia’s &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transhumanism"&gt;definition of transhumanism&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transhumanism…affirms the possibility and desirability of fundamentally transforming the human condition…to greatly enhance human intellectual, physical, and psychological capacities &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the philosophical core of transhumanism, and the fundamental core of the biblical story - a narrative which from back to front is an expression of the idea of human identity as perpetually fluid and self-transcendent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Biblical Story of Humanity&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The very first chapter of the Hebrew bible sets out to define human identity. In an explicit rejection of the Babylonian creation myths, which portrayed human beings as slaves of the divine, the Jewish creation story portrays human beings as created to participate in the acts of God. Right at the beginning, humans are given the task of cultivating the earth, naming and categorizing the cosmos, and beginning the process of technological innovation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through the story of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, David, and Jesus, we see the continual embrace of bold new ways of being human and of living in the world. The story focuses on the power of individuals to change history, the power of intellect and imagination to transcend circumstance, and the importance of foresight in overcoming limits to human growth. This is what the bible means by &lt;em&gt;faith&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we arrive at the New Testament, we see Jesus fully living out his human identity as a participation in the acts and creativity of God. And in a way no other human had before, Jesus confronts the looming threats to human growth and progress, and succeeds in opening a path to the future. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The apostle Paul is quite explicit that Jesus was spawning a “new humanity”. This humanity was no longer going to be limited or defined by the things that bound it before - geography, politics, race, gender, or the circumstances of one's birth. This humanity was going to be limitless, drawn into the infinite upward spiral towards God. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Fuel of Our Transformation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This brings us to the crux of Wesley Smith’s argument. In Christianity, our transformation is fueled by God. In transhumanism, we desire to transform ourselves. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But to put these in contrast is to misunderstand them both. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grace is not the thing that removes our ability to act, certainly not the thing that &lt;em&gt;forbids&lt;/em&gt; action. Grace is the thing which enables us, which empowers us to do what is needed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We all live by grace. You and I are only here by virtue of the free gifts bestowed on us by generations of ancestors. Our very survival depends on the infrastructure built by successive civilizations, each one building on the one before. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this grace wasn't given us so that we would stagnate, refusing to act. Neither was this grace given us so that we would be limited by what had been done. On the contrary - this grace was given us so that we would &lt;em&gt;act&lt;/em&gt;, and in acting, contribute something to others, a further grace for the broadening of possibility and the future. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Christianity is not just compatible with the desire to reach beyond ourselves, it is the &lt;em&gt;call&lt;/em&gt; to reach beyond ourselves, in recognition of and empowered by the grace bestowed upon us. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Works of God&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Christianity, we are called to do the works of the one who sent us - the works of healing the sick, feeding the hungry, and bringing life to the dead. In doing so, we join in the work of God, and embrace the true meaning of humanity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some might argue that since Jesus healed the sick through supernatural power, modern medical technology has nothing to do with Christianity. But the opposite is true - Jesus healed as a sign of the direction of God’s work. In his signs, Jesus tied the material and the spiritual together, and called us to utilize our skills and our technology towards compassion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, all of humanity's technological efforts arise hand in hand with our spirituality. The scientific process itself is a spiritual endeavor of cooperation, honesty, and tolerance, and it is not something that humanity has always been able to sustain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So our desire to advance science and technology is as much a spiritual exercise as it is a material one. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is exactly what we see in Jesus - a very practical concern for people's material well-being, coupled with the realization that ultimate progress can only be sustained through spiritual development. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Purpose of Suffering&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wesley Smith suggests that Christianity sees redemptive value in suffering, while transhumanism tries to avoid suffering altogether. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Christianity never seeks out suffering for its own sake. The suffering in Christianity is always the struggle to rescue others and to overcome adversity. It is the heroic effort of enduring on behalf of the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is the same in transhumanism - we struggle and suffer now so that we may eliminate sufferings from the world. We fight to eradicate disease, to achieve freedoms, to turn back the clock of aging. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Christianity and transhumanism, we neither embrace suffering nor flee from it. Instead, we see it as the necessary evil we must pass through in order to achieve a better world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The End of Ends&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A popular Christian eschatology suggests that the entire cosmos will shortly be terminated, putting an end to our meaningless efforts, and our futile obsessions with material reality. This would suggest that Christianity and transhumanism are diametrically opposed - transhumanism trying to hold on to a world which Christianity is trying to get rid of.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this idea has almost nothing to do with orthodox Christianity or the biblical story. The biblical story is about the transformation of the world, not the abandonment of it; the redemption of our strivings, not their futility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the meaning of Jesus himself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Jesus we see the unification of the human and the divine, the embrace of both our physicality and our limitlessness. Jesus shows us that our world is not to be abandoned, but transformed; that life is not futile, but full of hope. In his bodily existence, he affirms our science, our technology, our medicine, our present reality and our future potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And so every &lt;em&gt;end&lt;/em&gt; in Christianity is the end of boundaries, the end of constraints, the end of limitations. Every end is a possibility, drawing us past the hopelessness of short-term thinking, past the mentality of current limits, and toward the eternal rise of life, compassion, and progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is Christianity, and this is transhumanism.&lt;/p&gt;

I don’t mean that it has to be tedious or boring or anger-inducing or something like that. I mean that the &lt;em&gt;meaning&lt;/em&gt; is not just floating on the surface, waiting to be scooped off like so much pond scum. No, the meaning is deep and immersive, and you can’t get to it unless you fall in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it is soaking you, when it is filling every pore, then you may start to get a feeling for what’s going on. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is because scripture is most fundamentally &lt;em&gt;art&lt;/em&gt;. You might have been less surprised if I said &lt;em&gt;literature&lt;/em&gt;, but of course, literature is just a form of art that we sometimes forget is art. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Art is meant to change you. Art is not created just for the surface-level effect of &lt;em&gt;figuring out what it means&lt;/em&gt;, but for the change that happens in the viewer as they view it. When you look at a painting, “figure out what it means”, and then move on, you’ve missed the point of looking at paintings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lot of people do the same thing with scripture. Some branches of Christianity even cherish this dismissive attitude as the only true and proper approach to take. Just the facts, ma’am. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this is far from the approach modeled to us by the writers of scripture themselves. They remark, for example, on the fact that the ancient prophets &lt;a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Peter+1%3A10-12&amp;version=NIV"&gt;did not understand&lt;/a&gt; what they were prophesying. It is not that the ancient prophets secretly understood that Jesus was coming in this way and in this form, it’s that without knowing any of this, they prophesied in ways that leapt forward into the future, and evoked a set of expectations and hopes that could only ultimately be fulfilled in Christ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their prophecies were thus not exhausted by their own &lt;a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Peter+1%3A20&amp;version=NIV"&gt;personal interpretations&lt;/a&gt;, but were a matter of something moving inside of them, inspiring them to speak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the nature of art. An artist, when truly creating art, does not fully understand what it is that they are creating. Something inside them is moving, and though one or two meanings may be apparent, deeper meanings are hidden within, pushing their way to the surface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is not that all meaning is in the eye of the beholder. It is not that art is open to any interpretation, as if there was nothing real happening within it. Some interpretations are false, some are true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What makes art distinctive is that there are always multiple true meanings, playing together in unison. Just as a musical chord is formed by playing multiple notes together, the experience and depth of art is formed by playing multiple meanings together. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not every note belongs in the chord. Not every meaning is truly in the art. But we are invited to harmonize, to hum a note that &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; belong, but which is perhaps not quite apparent. With music, we may do this silently, or we may do it out loud. With paintings, we may do it in our emotions, or we may do it in our reactions. With scripture, we may do it unconsciously, or we may do it in our interpretations, or in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Truly listening &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; humming along. You don’t get out of it, you can’t get out of it. Instead, it situates you, and you become part of the chorus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heaven help you if you sing a discordant note. But heaven bless you if you hear where the music is going, and at the right moment, raise your voice to crescendo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do we know whether our contribution is in harmony or is discordant? In a sense, we don’t, until everyone’s contribution is &lt;a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+cor+3%3A13-15&amp;version=NIV"&gt;tested by the fire&lt;/a&gt; of performance. But as musicians, we learn to listen. We learn to listen to the other voices, to the arc of the music so far, to the themes that have been played and are likely to be played again, to the ebb and flow of emphasis and rhythm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then we open our mouths and sing, because the music is moving inside of us.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2003/10/04/roughdraft-finally-released-10032003/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2003/10/04/roughdraft-finally-released-10032003/</link><pubDate>Sat Oct 04 02:05:00 CDT 2003</pubDate><title>RoughDraft finally released! - 10/03/2003</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>SEATTLE, WA - The moment has finally come and the critics are raving.

We had never been to Pburgh before, so it was an adventure for us. It's so funny, because you're driving through all this countryside that is basically just like WV out-in-the-middle-of-nowhere-land, and then you pass through a tunnel and burst out onto this huge city scene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, anyway, we got stuck in long lines of traffic, because there was apparently a Pirates game that night. (I'm just guessing...the interstate said "Pirate Parking" all along it). Then, of course we took the wrong turn, and took a fun little mini-tour of downtown Pittsburgh. Which was impressive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But eventually we ended up at the right place, set up our stuff (right in front of a food table, incidentally), and played our concert.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, right in the middle of our show, an 83-year-old lady got up, stood in front of us, and blew us 10 kisses. I don't think we've ever gotten such a compliment before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That made the trip worthwhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Afterwards, we packed up and headed out, getting on the road about 10pm. We drove until 1am, then stopped at a rest stop and slept for 2 hours. I woke up at 3:10, and we drove on, getting home about 4:30am.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leaving us nice and exhausted for Saturday... :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-micah &amp;amp; the other redding brothers&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2008/11/10/zehnder-the-band-the-men-the-mission/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2008/11/10/zehnder-the-band-the-men-the-mission/</link><pubDate>Mon Nov 10 13:54:00 CST 2008</pubDate><title>Zehnder: the band, the men, the mission</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>I received Zehnder's newest album: "Going Up" the other day.

It's being offered as worship music.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It sounds quite unique. I wonder if they anticipate other people singing along to this? I don't really think it has either the hymn-like or devo-song feel that allows for people to sing along. But that doesn't mean it's bad. It just means it's not simple and repetitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The album's sound is kind of "acoustic L.A." It reminds me vaguely of Alanis Morissette. But it is more acoustic, and definitely, uh, more christian.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately, it might be really good for getting into a kind of mystical trance.

Trying to type was weird at first - my fingers didn't bend the right way, I kept tripping over my own hands, my arms got fatigued quickly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who knew typing was a skill you lose when you're not using it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've been reluctant to get back into writing. There's so much to narrate, so many stories to tell. I was only able to share a few of my experiences while I was traveling, due to the spotty internet connections, trying to write up everything on my iPhone, and generally being distracted by things like swimming in the Dead Sea, crawling inside the pyramids, riding camels through Petra, and canoeing in Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it's coming. I'll be sharing some of my stories, as well as the blizzard of thoughts that have been spinning through my mind ever since I got back. Part of me wants to sort these out, and do this chronologically and in order, and tell all the stories first - but that's not going to happen. I'm going to pick back up, writing as usual, dropping in my notes and stories and pictures as I process them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you missed the things I did share while I was gone, here they are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/series/around-world-40-days"&gt;http://micahredding.com/blog/series/around-world-40-days&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was also able to post a few things to &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/micahtredding"&gt;twitter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://facebook.com/micahredding"&gt;facebook&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several of you have sent me really great notes and encouragement, and I can't thank you enough.

Is it shared location? Shared experiences? Shared beliefs? Is it even possible to have significant community without the benefit of physical presence?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think so, but I think we need a new way of thinking about community.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that we have to understand community in terms of SHARED CREATION.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the things I do is to write songs. In the rare moment when I write one that is really, deeply good, I feel like I've touched something deep inside me. I feel like I've tapped into something God gave me, and I value that moment of creativity for its own sake, even if no one else ever hears that song.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the same impulse that leads me to write the song compels me to share it with others. And so I go out and spread it, sharing it with those I feel will be receptive to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most definitions of "community" stop there. Among churches, "community" means that everyone listens to the same sermons. Marketers think of "community" as people who like the same music, or watch the same reality TV shows. Online "community" is usually about being a fan of something, like Star Wars or Macintosh computers. These types of "community" are all about having a central flow of information or a central source of creativity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's a pretty pale definition of community. Although it is an attempt to build community on the basis of shared beliefs or interests, it's a poor replacement for the traditional concept. This is why many churches (and a lot of modern life) seem pretty shallow and unfulfilling; their idea of community is building up a certain size listening audience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having people hear my song is good, but when someone hears the song and is inspired to go out and create something themselves, that is something entirely different. That's how most musicians become musicians; and that's how it worked for me. Particular musicians created music that affected me deeply, and sparked my desire to do something as profound as they did. And they made me realize, to my amazement, that I was capable of doing so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the people who've heard the song turn around and create music, art, lifestyle changes, literature, or movements, then an amazing process has started.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That process continues when those people come back and inspire me with their creations. And when the people who've been inspired by the song begin to create and inspire each other, over and over and over...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's when I think community has begun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So community is not just shared interests or activities, or being in the same audience. Instead, real community happens when our creation and inspiration of each other becomes intertwined, and we're all involved in the creative process together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A "community" needs to do more than listen to, or discuss, the same things. A community needs to be involved in actually creating things, drawing inspiration from each other, allowing shared ideas to cross-pollinate.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/02/23/good-and-evil-paradox-and-contradiction/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/02/23/good-and-evil-paradox-and-contradiction/</link><pubDate>Thu Feb 23 12:12:15 CST 2012</pubDate><title>Good and Evil, Paradox and Contradiction</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>Sorry things are a little slow lately.

...</description><content:encoded>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Sorry things are a little slow lately. I've been working on some big thoughts, trying to fit them together and make them dance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in the meantime, let me share a few thoughts about good and evil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New Testament habitually engages in the very confusing practice of both affirming something and disavowing it at the same time. This could be simple contradiction - but it's not. It's very clear that this is being done on purpose, and it's very clear why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The writers are faced with the very difficult task of putting forward entirely new categories of thought. Humans aren't very good at dealing with new categories of thought, and so we have to use tricks to be able to handle them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first trick is simple disagreement. It was easy, for example, for Stephen to testify to Jerusalem's leaders that God does not live in temples. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But for some purposes, that isn't enough. Sometimes the concept you're disagreeing with is so complex that it is necessary to affirm some parts of the concept, while denying others. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This leads to the second trick: re-interpretation. The author of Hebrews can then explain how there is a "spiritual temple", which supersedes the physical one. On one level, Hebrews is doing the same thing as Stephen does. But Hebrews is also showing how to transfer all the good concepts about the temple onto something more productive (in this case, one's direct relationship with God).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We do this all the time in our own conversations. It's only when we are dealing with ancient texts and unfamiliar contexts that this seems so foreign. We look for simple agreement, and instead find seeming contradiction. But the contradictions only arise because the authors are trying hard to translate their ideas into concepts we can deal with. The clearest way they know how to do this is to use multiple conflicting metaphors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New Testament does the same thing with the concept of good and evil. Good and evil had previously been understood as defined by the Law. But Jesus had explained that the purpose of the Law was to create love in its hearers. So &lt;a href="http://biblia.com/bible/esv/Ro13.8"&gt;in Romans&lt;/a&gt;, Paul can say that love fulfills the Law, while in other places, he can suggest that the Law has been removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both are, of course, true. In one respect, the Law was entirely gone. In a more complex sense, the Law had been transferred from an external system of regulation to an internal system of motivation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A similar thing happens with the concept of sin. &lt;a href="http://biblia.com/bible/esv/1Jn1.1-10"&gt;John&lt;/a&gt; can seemingly say that we do not sin, and yet also say that if we deny sinning, we are sinners for that very denial!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do we understand this? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;First&lt;/em&gt;, sin should be understood as a term for violence. The Law was about curtailing violence, and Jesus explained how violence has deep internal roots. Violence is present psychologically as hate, because hate wants to destroy, but also as covetousness, because covetousness drags us directly into conflict with others. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Second&lt;/em&gt;, sin should be understood as a term for entrapment. If we deny the effects of hatred and covetousness on ourselves, it is probably because we are so deeply controlled by them that we can longer see the difference. But if we acknowledge their effects, we loosen their grip. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once we realize this, we can begin to see the traps surrounding us. To try to judge ourselves on the basis of Law is to blind ourselves to the real violence within us. To deny the violence within us is to lock ourselves into it. But to acknowledge our own internal violence (even when it is not manifested openly) is to free ourselves of its power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Usually, we can only see our own violence when we are confronted with love. This is why Jesus provoked such a brutal reaction in the ancient world - his very existence exposed and challenged everything else. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we encounter love, it exposes everything within us. It destroys &lt;em&gt;our&lt;/em&gt; good and evil, and reveals the &lt;em&gt;true&lt;/em&gt; good and evil. It illuminates the internal nature of violence, allowing us to see it in ourselves, and to begin to work free of it. And it empowers us with a source for action far beyond a set of external guidelines. &lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2013/01/03/1357193911/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2013/01/03/1357193911/</link><pubDate>Thu Jan 03 00:18:31 CST 2013</pubDate><title>1357193911</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>I've toyed with the idea of abandoning the term "Christian" before.

Here's the problem with that: in doing so, I would be abandoning the rich history and language surrounding that term. In the short term, this would mean a lot fewer obstacles to my ideas, but in the long term, it would deprive me and others of all that we could have access to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, the process of rediscovering important concepts (things like "atonement", "redemption", etc) within a new framework of thought is one of the great joys of my life. To discover that something initially seen as problematic is actually a beautiful and rational thing is a wonderful experience. And when you make that discovery, you have suddenly gained a world of rich meaning and poetry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Few people succeed at creating a language from scratch. I think the reason is that existing languages have had millions of people pouring their hopes and dreams into them. There is simply no way to recreate that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, even Christianity wasn't started from scratch. It could never have flourished without the deep vein of historic Judaism it drew from. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, this is something I struggle with all the time. But my suggestion would be to not worry so much about the short-term obstacles, and focus instead on building reservoirs of meaning for the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/2011/09/16/language"&gt;http://micahredding.com/blog/2011/09/16/language&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/transfigurism/permalink/10152387406715436/?comment_id=10152387538150436&amp;offset=0&amp;total_comments=1"&gt;https://www.facebook.com/groups/transfigurism/permalink/10152387406715436/?comment_id=10152387538150436&amp;offset=0&amp;total_comments=1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/unclean-christianity/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/unclean-christianity/</link><pubDate>Mon Dec 05 01:28:07 CST 2016</pubDate><title>Unclean Christianity</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>In the ancient world, leprosy was incredibly *unclean*—if you had it, you were not simply unhealthy, you were cast out of society.

For you to touch anyone was to risk contaminating them. You had to live on the outskirts of town, shouting “unclean! unclean!” wherever you went, so that normal people could get out of your way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you did touch someone, they would immediately become unclean as well. They would have to go to the temple and do a cleansing ritual to make sure they were free of the disease, and to be accepted back into society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So in the Gospels, when lepers come to Jesus, he is not supposed to touch them. He is a holy man, and their uncleanness could contaminate his holiness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weirdly enough, that’s not how it works. People with leprosy keep coming to Jesus, and Jesus keeps touching them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And instead of Jesus becoming &lt;em&gt;unclean&lt;/em&gt;, the lepers become &lt;em&gt;cleansed&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, Jesus can touch uncleanness, evil, sin, impurity, anything—and it doesn’t make him dirty, it makes &lt;em&gt;them&lt;/em&gt; clean. In the Gospels, it isn’t leprosy that is the most infectious disease—it is Jesus himself! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is true for almost everything. Everything he touches becomes infected with health—everything he touches becomes clean. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So when Jesus goes to the cross—the ultimate expression of being under a curse, &lt;a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians+3%3A13&amp;version=NIV"&gt;according to Galatians&lt;/a&gt;—the curse is broken, and even the cross itself is transformed. Instead of a symbol of violent power, it becomes a symbol of self-giving love. Instead of embodying the power of death, it comes to embody the power of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe we Christians ought to take this more seriously. Jesus is an infectious agent. He is virulent and contagious. Instead of trying to keep him locked away in rooms where people approach him with appropriate questions and dignity, maybe we should let him loose in the world. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After all, when Jesus calls his first disciples, he doesn’t ask them to accept a metaphysical system, or buy into a set of propositions. He just asks them to follow along—because he knows what happens when people get near him. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They become infected. They become contagious. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe we need to stop trying to keep our religion safe and clean and organized, and just let it out into the messy and insincere and ironic and imprecise and sinful and ugly world. Maybe we need to invite people to engage with Jesus in whatever way they can, no matter how problematic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because once Jesus is set loose, there’s no telling where he will end up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And when Jesus gets his hands dirty, even the dirt becomes clean.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2005/06/15/this-weekend-back-in-charleston/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2005/06/15/this-weekend-back-in-charleston/</link><pubDate>Wed Jun 15 06:10:00 CDT 2005</pubDate><title>This Weekend back in Charleston!</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>This weekend, we will finally be returning to Charleston.

Sometimes, new things are terrifying—even demonic. Sometimes, new things are freedom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Talking to Emily the other day, I was struck by how quickly we can switch between these responses. I remember the movie &lt;a href="http://amzn.to/29Xjv5o"&gt;Flight of the Navigator&lt;/a&gt; as an imaginative adventure, with aliens and time travel. I think of it as fun. But she remembers catching glimpses of it on other people’s televisions, seeing a boy walking up to his own house, unaware that he has traveled in time, struggling with the shocking and unexplainable fact that suddenly no one recognizes him or knows who he is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In that light, it seems a lot like a horror film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, I have always loved the idea of space travel. And I loved the movie &lt;a href="http://amzn.to/29Y7FeE"&gt;Gravity&lt;/a&gt;. But &lt;em&gt;Gravity&lt;/em&gt; is not a movie about the joys and wonder of space. It’s more a film about the horror of realizing that in space, there is no &lt;em&gt;down&lt;/em&gt;. Without gravity, you can no longer orient yourself, or get a grip on your relationship with the rest of the universe. &lt;em&gt;Gravity&lt;/em&gt; is really a psychological terror trip about what it’s like to exist in the absence of gravity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is outer space a place of horror? Or is it a place of wonder and exploration?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think it’s both. In fact, maybe horror and wonder are two sides of the same coin — two different ways we react to the same phenomenon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know for me, encountering a tornado or a massive storm elicits this kind of response—a combination of wonder and horror, terror and love. It leaves me feeling like I suddenly understand the way Old Testament prophets reacted to the appearance of Yahweh. As if, there is nothing in existence more dangerous—and nothing in existence more worthy of awe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think this is inevitable when we step outside of the world we know. Wander outside of the warmth and safety of our “nests”, our little bubbles of protected reality where things are easy and comprehensible, and we are suddenly confronted with the terror of knowing just how much we do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's no way to make space “safe”. There’s no way to tame the terror of the third dimension, in all its glory. Beyond the world of gravity, there is no up or down, no “grounding” or “rooting” or “anchoring”. There is just raw, undifferentiated freedom, and all it entails.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the third dimension is terrifying, how much more the fourth dimension? How do we deal with the fact that time stubbornly refuses to match our intuitions, that it runs at different speeds for different people, and that outside of the pocket of oxygen we live in, time isn’t even remotely constant for the rest of the universe?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we venture out into the universe, this will be something we have to grapple with. Twins who age at different rates, parents who come back from voyages younger than their children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps you can begin to sympathize with how people felt when they discovered that the earth wasn’t flat — that other people were experiencing night while they were experiencing day, that other people experienced as “up” what they called “down”. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do we deal with this terror?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or maybe, how do we turn this terror into awe? How do we experience this horror and disorientation as freedom and joy?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end, all of these scenarios are the same. The terror of living on a globe is the freedom of living on a globe. The disorientation of outer space is the radical liberation of escaping a gravity well. The confusion of inconsistent timelines is a source of wonder and awe at the universe we live in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we watch a movie, we know how to tell the difference between horror and joy: we simply listen to the music. The exact same scene, played back with different music, becomes a different scene entirely. A tense moment, punctuated by music, suddenly changes with a simple shift in the tune. A moment we thought was scary, ends up being funny. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we look out into the cosmos, we play a soundtrack in our heads. When we contemplate future technologies or journeys into the unknown, we hear music. When we discover that in our universe, there is ultimately no up or down, no fast or slow, no fixed frame of reference — we hear the pounding of keys. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But is it playing in a major or a minor key? Is the music striking fear into your heart—or ringing out excitement and adventure and fun?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think the difference might come down to which stories you listen to. Read enough stories about the terrors of the unknown, and terrifying songs will be sure to play. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But read and watch and enact enough stories about &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/micah-redding/the-faith-of-the-martian_b_9128666.html"&gt;faith&lt;/a&gt;—about our predecessors leaving behind safety and security to pursue new continents, new wildernesses, the unknown—and you may hear the rising sounds of a parade getting started.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This, after all, is what “faith” really means. It’s not about believing that the universe isn’t scary, that there really is an up and down, or that the world is actually flat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s about looking out into the vast expanse—the same vast expanse that strikes fear into men’s souls—and hearing the ringing sounds of freedom.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/omega-point-theory/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/omega-point-theory/</link><pubDate>Sun Jul 03 16:04:24 CDT 2016</pubDate><title>The Omega Point Theory</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>One of the reasons that science has been widely regarded as an atheistic enterprise over the years, is that for quite a while now, it has preached a future of relentless annihilation.

Ever since the ...</description><content:encoded>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons that science has been widely regarded as an atheistic enterprise over the years, is that for quite a while now, it has preached a future of relentless annihilation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ever since the laws of thermodynamics were formulated, the outcome has appeared certain. Available energy is decreasing all the time, as all systems gradually reach equilibrium with their environments. The end result, it would seem, is the “heat death”, where everything has finally smoothed out to await an eternity of no change, no light, no life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus, no matter how great a civilization we may build, no matter how high our aspirations may rise, they are all ultimately doomed to destruction. Every life, every love, everything we value, must be erased in the slow march towards eternal oblivion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This result has seemed so sure, so certain and established, that Bertrand Russell declared life must henceforth be built on the foundation of pure despair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus declares science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or does it? Over the years, a number of scientists have questioned these conclusions. Do the laws of thermodynamics &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to lead to this dismal end, or are there other possibilities? Particularly, can we &lt;em&gt;do something&lt;/em&gt; about all of this?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One physicist took this question and ran with it. &lt;em&gt;What would it take,&lt;/em&gt; he asked, &lt;em&gt;for life to exist all the way to the end of time?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That physicist was Frank Tipler, and the result of his question is the Omega Point Theory. The Omega Point Theory is both a physical theory of cosmology, and a proposal for the future of life in this universe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I &lt;a href="http://brickcaster.com/christiantranshumanist/19"&gt;recently interviewed Tipler&lt;/a&gt; on the scientific, philosophical, and theological ramifications of his theory. Today, I’ll simply look at the proposal itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What would it take for life to survive all the way to the end of time?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, first of all, we’re going to have to get off this planet. Within 4 billion years, the sun will have expanded to engulf the entire earth. But even before that, just one billion years from now, the sun will have become so enlarged, all life on earth will be extinct. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This won’t simply be a tragedy for the human race—it will be a tragedy for all life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if we do leave the planet, we can carry life with us. All the species of plants and animals, ecosystems and living organisms, both currently living, and long extinct, can be brought back to life to flourish on new worlds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a supercomputer, the nano-machines we should have in a few years, and a virtual ‘Noah’s Ark’ of DNA sequences, we should be able to construct a lightweight spacecraft that can venture to other star systems, and seed new living worlds. And it should be able to do this at a substantial fraction of the speed of light. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So that’s the first step.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But simply seeding another world does not mean life is out of danger. There are far bigger dangers on the way, from supernovas to hypernovas to supermassive black holes. Life will have to keep moving and diversifying in order to insure its continued survival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So these new worlds will themselves launch expeditions to new worlds. And in less than a million years, our galaxy will have come alive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What happens if we encounter alien life somewhere along the way? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we encounter alien life, we will want to do everything in our power to protect and preserve it. There are no truly scarce resources in the universe, no reasons for us to launch a battle over water rights, for example. The most valuable thing aliens could offer us is information, history, perspective—and we will provide the same to them. And then we will continue together, spreading and preserving life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If this process continues, then life will continue beyond the Milky Way and into other galaxies. And eventually life will be expanding nearly as fast as the cosmos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s talk about the universe for a moment. Science suggests that the universe began approximately 13 billion years ago, and has been expanding rapidly ever since. In fact, that expansion is accelerating. The universe is getting larger, faster and faster all the time. Eventually, if that continues, then we will experience another of the apocalyptic despair scenarios of science: The Big Rip. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Big Rip is a bit like a balloon popping. It keeps getting bigger and bigger, and then goes too far. Now, instead of one giant balloon, you have tiny fractured pieces everywhere. That’s kind of what might happen to our universe: every galaxy cut off from every other galaxy, every star system cut off from every other star system, eventually everyone cut off from everyone else. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s possibly even more despair-provoking than the heat death is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this is where the Omega Point Theory offers its first unusual suggestion: Life can stop this from happening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As life spreads from galaxy to galaxy, from supercluster to supercluster, it has the power to alter the future development of the universe. Life can change the universe from &lt;em&gt;open&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;closed&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An &lt;em&gt;open universe&lt;/em&gt; is one which keeps expanding forever, as we’ve described. This is what the universe presumably is right now. A &lt;em&gt;closed universe&lt;/em&gt;, on the other hand, expands for a while, and then contracts. According to the Omega Point Theory, this is the future path all life will prefer, and life will have the power to make it happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s worth pointing out that I am not a scientist. I cannot evaluate the merit of the proposed mechanism for “closing the universe”. As I understand it, it basically boils down to using up the dark energy that’s currently causing the acceleration, and letting gravity regain the upper hand. Doing this would have the advantage of giving all living beings a nearly unlimited energy supply, while simultaneously insuring the survival of life to the end of time. That’s what we call a win-win scenario.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond the question of &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; it might be accomplished, &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; would life want to close the universe? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Omega Point Theory, this provides the maximum possible future for life. Every other scenario leads to a Big Rip, Big Freeze, or some other horrific variation on the heath death. But if we close the universe, then we are directing it to a &lt;em&gt;Big Crunch&lt;/em&gt;. And as we head towards the Big Crunch, something special happens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The universe, now completely populated by life, begins to contract. And as it does so, communication between galaxies and star systems becomes easier and easier. It becomes simpler and simpler to coordinate across vast distances, and to cooperate between worlds. Larger and larger cooperative enterprises and ecosystems can be constructed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gradually, the entire universe can coordinate its actions. And just as life directed the universe to become closed, life can steer the collapse of the universe in the most beneficial way possible. As it does so, the opposite of the heat death emerges. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of everything in the universe heading towards a smooth, lifeless equilibrium, the universe heads in the direction of more intensity, more energy, more complexity and differentiation. The gravitational energy of the collapse itself provides the “fuel”—not just to keep life going, but to accelerate its development and growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And life will need to grow. The intensifying conditions in the collapsing phase of the universe will render life &lt;em&gt;as we know it&lt;/em&gt; increasingly difficult, and then impossible. But that won’t stop life itself—Life can continue to grow and flourish in incredible new ways. We will see creatures emerge that span solar systems, then galaxies, then superclusters. These beings will flourish and thrive in conditions we cannot fathom. Just as microbes today thrive in volcanoes, these beings of the far future will thrive in unimaginable light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And as they work together, spanning the universe, coordinating its development, achieving increasing heights of power and organization and complexity, they will drive the evolution of the cosmos all the way to the end of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve been tossing around that phrase, “the end of time”, but I haven’t defined it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within the despair scenarios of the Big Freeze, the Big Rip, or the heat death, there technically is no end. Instead, life becomes impossible and dies out, and then the universe goes on for a lifeless, colorless eternity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in the Big Crunch scenario proposed by the Omega Point Theory, this question becomes a little more tricky. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Time, after all, is basically a measure of activity. A year is the time it takes for the earth to orbit the sun, a day is the time it takes for the earth to spin through one rotation, and all of those measurements are really about how many things we can do, how many thoughts we can think, how many moments we can experience. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even in a scientific framework, time is measured in vibrations of certain atoms. At every level, it comes back to events and our experiences of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the unique thing about the collapse of the universe, is that as the universe gets smaller, the energy available for life increases exponentially. And as it does so, communication, power, and complexity keep accelerating. &lt;em&gt;Life speeds up&lt;/em&gt;. More happens every second than it did the second before. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One moment, someone writes a book, the next moment, a thousand books, the next moment, a million books. One moment, someone thinks a single thought, the next moment, a million thoughts, the next moment, a trillion thoughts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The beings of the distant future would be living faster every moment. But this means that for them, time would be slowing down. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of the end growing closer, and time growing short, the end would be getting &lt;em&gt;further away&lt;/em&gt;. One second, the end might be a billion moments in the future—the next second, it could be a trillion moments in the future. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Life in the universe would be endlessly manufacturing time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And so, even though the universe ends in a finite amount of conventional time, it will take an infinite number of moments to get there. Thus, in one measure of time, the universe has a finite end point. But from the perspective of life itself, history is infinite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The end itself is rather simple. The universe continues to collapse, life continues to advance, complexity and organization and power continue to increase, intelligence continues to grow, and as the universe gets smaller and smaller, all of these accelerate exponentially. When the universe reaches its final point, life reaches infinity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the Omega Point, the ultimate singularity. Infinitely dense, infinitely complex, infinitely intelligent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And most importantly, infinitely &lt;em&gt;alive&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the theory was proposed, it has provoked a lot of discussion. Tipler has not been shy about describing all kinds of ramifications of this theory, which has rubbed some people the wrong way. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, the Omega Point Theory requires a closed universe. When the theory was first proposed, many people thought the universe might naturally be closed. We now know it to be open. As a result, some people have considered the Omega Point Theory to be disproven. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this ignores an important point: &lt;em&gt;life can decide&lt;/em&gt;. Life exists to make the improbable probable. And if Tipler is right, life will want to close the universe, so that instead of dying out, life can exist at greater and greater levels, all the way to the end of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;”The fate of the Universe is a decision yet to be made, one which we will intelligently consider when the time is right." - Ray Kurzweil&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’d like to read more about the Omega Point Theory as a physical theory, I’d suggest David’s Deutsch’s overview from &lt;a href="http://amzn.to/29gbOeO"&gt;The Fabric of Reality&lt;/a&gt;. His whole book is great, and you should read it. An excerpt from the relevant chapter on the Omega Point is &lt;a href="http://129.81.170.14/~tipler/physicist.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’d like to read Tipler’s work, I’d suggest starting with &lt;a href="http://amzn.to/29cbFJt"&gt;The Physics of Immortality&lt;/a&gt;, which explores an earlier version of the theory. If you’d like to hear Tipler and I discuss his theory and some of its implications, listen to &lt;a href="http://brickcaster.com/christiantranshumanist/19"&gt;this episode&lt;/a&gt; of the Christian Transhumanist Podcast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And if you’d like to explore the theological ramifications of all of this—well, that’s what I’m here for. Stay tuned. :)&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2011/09/16/disrupt/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2011/09/16/disrupt/</link><pubDate>Fri Sep 16 13:57:53 CDT 2011</pubDate><title>Disrupt</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>We're all looking for something to disrupt our life - to lift from us the heavy weight of free will and personal choice.

It was a pretty awesome event, simply because we made the decision to let Gabe bring his &lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic;"&gt;djembe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; instead of his full drumset. Recently, we've discovered that this actually makes for a pretty cool show, and DRAMATICALLY reduces the amount of stuff that we have to pack, unpack, carry, setup, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, anyway, we setup in about 10 minutes, and started playing. Our show consisted of some originals (Coming Round, Anger, Lord of Winter, Mr Rogers), and then our own rendition of God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen and Carol of The Bells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, it just so happened that we neglected to bring a guitar cable, so the sound guys ran over to a local music store and bought one. Which alerted us to the fact that there was a music store there. So after we had finished playing, we decided to visit this store to see what delightful things we might discover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, much to our delight, we found some cheap guitar stands and a &lt;span style="font-style:italic;"&gt;very&lt;/span&gt; cheap bass case. This was a nice development, as we were planning to buy a case anyway, and this saved us a bunch of money. So we sauntered out of the shop feeling very good about ourselves, just in time to see a long line of firetrucks and ambulances rolling down the street.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It turns out that a pickup truck had hit the curb and flipped, landing on its side, and smashing a car just a few parking spaces away from the car of our friend Aimee, who had driven into town just to see us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately, it turned out that since she was in the music store with us, she avoided this incident completely, and after we helped her get her car out from behind the emergency vehicles, was completely fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So we took her to a local coffeeshop to calm down, and while we were in the shop, a semi-truck made a wrong turn and hit a car outside. We decided we needed to get out of town before we caused any more trouble...so we went home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While we were at home in our apartment, we heard a huge screeching noise, and looked outside to see a car crumpled by the side of the road. We ran down to check on the occupants of the car. Fortunately, no one was injured, but the car flipped over some huge landscaping rocks, and broke the back axle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was our Day of the Three Car Wrecks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-micah&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2007/07/02/travel-and-life/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2007/07/02/travel-and-life/</link><pubDate>Mon Jul 02 05:01:00 CDT 2007</pubDate><title>Travel and Life</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>We just got back from a great weekend, involving a trip to WV, spending some time with our grandparents, hauling a large radio antenna across town on top of our car, getting stung by a wasp, staying o...</description><content:encoded>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;We just got back from a great weekend, involving a trip to WV, spending some time with our grandparents, hauling a large radio antenna across town on top of our car, getting stung by a wasp, staying out until 2am, dealing with some "interesting" characters, and playing like crazy.

Here's a pattern I see in the bible. First, Genesis 1:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Begin: the earth is formless and void and dark.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Day 0: God said: "Let there be light!"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Day 1: Divided the Light from the Darkness&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Day 2: Divided the Sky from the Water&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Day 3: Divided the Land from the Sea&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Day 4: Filled the Light and Darkness with Sun, Moon, stars&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Day 5: Filled the Sky and Water with Birds and Fish&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Day 6: Filled the Land with Animals and Humans&lt;br /&gt;(anticipation of something new - humans)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Day 7: Rest&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now in this, there's an obvious pattern. 3 days of separation, then 3 days of filling in those separations with something to "rule" them. The sun is said to rule the day, the moon rules the night, birds rule the sky, fish rule the sea, and humanity rules the earth. It's a nice parallel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another thing I'm pulling out here is that what happens on Day 6, the last set of "fillings", sets the stage for an entirely different order of things. After Genesis 1, God will no longer be dealing with the sky and sea and land as much as he will be dealing with humanity. Humanity appears in this creation order as the anticipation of something new - the human order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, at least 6 days of this pattern seem to hold in another way as you continue to read through Genesis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Begin: a human is formed out of dust&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stage 0: God breathes into him the breath of life&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stage 1: Divided man from nature (naming the animals)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stage 2: Divided man from woman (the rib)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stage 3: Divided woman from serpent (temptation)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stage 4: Fill the division of man and nature (cursed with toil in working the ground)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stage 5: Fill the division of man and woman (cursed with pain in raising children)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stage 6: Fill the division of woman and serpent (cursed with enmity)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The curses God hands out line up precisely with the separations he caused the first time around. Where before man and woman were separate, now they will struggle with each other. And as Adam will have struggle bringing forth food from the ground, Eve will have struggle bringing forth children. In the same way, the serpent's offspring will struggle with Eve's offspring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And in the curse on the serpent, there is the anticipation of something new, a perplexing prophecy that indicates a new order of things is coming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your thoughts?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2006/06/24/what-i-thinkor-micah-enters-into-the-political-debate/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2006/06/24/what-i-thinkor-micah-enters-into-the-political-debate/</link><pubDate>Sat Jun 24 02:19:00 CDT 2006</pubDate><title>What I think...or, Micah enters into the political debate</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>I hate politics.And thus the source of my political opinion.

Guns and violence. If you don't pay your taxes, they will use guns to force you to do so. If you don't wear your seatbelt, they will fine you. And that fine means nothing except for the fact that if you don't pay it, they will ultimately threaten you with violence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taxes are just prettied up theft.&lt;br /&gt;Federal laws are no different than the rules laid down by the local mob.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the legitimacy of the government is just fancy clothing on a rotten corpse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-micah&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2006/12/28/how-to-be-a-weekend-rock-star/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2006/12/28/how-to-be-a-weekend-rock-star/</link><pubDate>Thu Dec 28 01:09:00 CST 2006</pubDate><title>How to be a weekend Rock Star</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>1.

Grow your hair long - but not long enough to get you fired from your day job.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tuck it behind your ears during the day to make it seem shorter. Joke about how you've been too busy working to go in for a haircut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;2. Hold a full band rehearsal in your apartment. Without getting evicted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic;"&gt;Second-Best Method:&lt;/span&gt; Call in sick at your job so you can have the band over during the day when nobody else in the apartment is home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic;"&gt;Best Method:&lt;/span&gt; Recruit everyone on the floor below you for your new band. Voila! No one left to complain about the noise. Soon, they'll all be jobless and penniless, and won't care, anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;3. Get carefully cultivated fake tattoos.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Real ones would get you in trouble with the boss. But fake ones have no &lt;a href="http://www.reddingbrothers.com/"&gt;Indie Credibility&lt;/a&gt; (see point #5). To convince everyone they're real, get really ugly ones. That way, everyone will think: "There's no way he would be sporting that if he could help it!"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;4. Get a Rock Star image. From a magazine.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a &lt;span class="misspell"&gt;bona&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class="misspell"&gt;fide&lt;/span&gt; productive working member of society, you're going to have trouble pulling off the rock star image. So you're going to have to steal someone &lt;span class="misspell"&gt;else's&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just sign up for one of those "free magazine" offers your annoying co-worker keep pushing at you, and get a subscription to &lt;span style="font-style:italic;"&gt;Rolling Stone&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span style="font-style:italic;"&gt;Paste&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span style="font-style:italic;"&gt;Spin&lt;/span&gt;. Then just rip out some photos of rock stars, and copy their clothing exactly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next month, repeat. This way you'll always be "cutting edge".&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;5. Get Indie Credibility.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;No one is going to believe you're a rock star until you start talking like one. So do two things: rail against the music establishment, and claim to hate anything released in the last decade. Talk about the glory days of rock, before Kurt Cobain "sold out" and joined Nirvana. That's right, even &lt;span style="font-style:italic;"&gt;Kurt Cobain&lt;/span&gt; isn't cool enough for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;6. Use company stationary to book the big shows.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Want to open for Motley &lt;span class="misspell"&gt;Crue&lt;/span&gt;? It helps if your request to open for them comes on the letterhead of a Fortune 500 company. Better yet, sign your boss's name. Agents will be more impressed to hear from Harvey Jefferson III than from Jimmy the Intern.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;7. Use your company copy machine to create fliers for your next big gig.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just be sure to print a nice Excel report too, so you can sandwich your fliers between spreadsheets, and convince any passerby that you just printed off 500 pages of financial data.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;8. Borrow your neighbor's minivan to carry all of your band equipment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tell him that it's for a "soccer emergency". He'll understand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;9. Tell your co-workers to come to your gig, but don't tell them you're the one playing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just tell them there's this &lt;a href="http://www.reddingbrothers.com/"&gt;awesome band&lt;/a&gt; that's been really hitting it big overseas. Let them feel the peer pressure burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;10. Play to a Huge Crowd.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simply sneak in to a &lt;span style="font-style:italic;"&gt;Hard Rock Cafe&lt;/span&gt; about an hour before another band's scheduled show and start setting up. Tell the manager that there have been some personnel changes lately, but you're still going to "rock the house". When the real band shows up, accuse them of stalking you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you follow all these steps, you will be well on your way to success as a weekend rockstar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-micah&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2010/01/18/one-mind/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2010/01/18/one-mind/</link><pubDate>Mon Jan 18 10:47:37 CST 2010</pubDate><title>One mind?</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>Yesterday, it occurred to me how much of our human relationships are characterized by guilt or judgment.

Guilt and being judgmental are two sides of the same blade, and that blade separates people into their own little self-focused domains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a moment I felt like I saw what it would be like to be free of these barriers. If you could really communicate fully with another human being - if you had no hesitation or self-consciousness in your interactions - wouldn't it be like having the same mind?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We know that the human brain can function as different entities, if barriers are introduced. TV shows love to dwell on the weirdness of multiple personality disorders, or the functioning of split-brain patients. When communication between the two halves of someone's brain is cut off, those two halves begin to function like different people. One hand may even fight the other hand for dominance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we can see a mind break into two different minds, doesn't it stand to reason that two minds might, for just a moment, act as one? This synchronicity would probably only last briefly, a tenuously balanced moment in which time freezes and we step outside the barriers in which we've lived our entire lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think this happens rarely, in fleeting moments, sometimes in young children, sometimes when someone looks face-on into another human being's suffering, sometimes in music, when the musician for a moment feels connected to the floor and the audience and the sky itself. In that moment, judgment ceases, and the individual flexes and stretches out into a much bigger world.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2008/11/27/interpreting-bible-basics/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2008/11/27/interpreting-bible-basics/</link><pubDate>Thu Nov 27 20:32:39 CST 2008</pubDate><title>Interpreting The Bible: The Basics</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>Logic

For that very reason, a lot of our traditions have approached the Bible as if it could be understood this way - as if it MUST be understood this way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Propositional logic works like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(A) All cats are red&lt;br/&gt;(B) Sam is a cat&lt;br/&gt;(C) Sam is red&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone knows that if both (A) and (B) are true, then (C) must be true. This works because it's unambiguous, clearly defined, and &lt;em&gt;needs no context&lt;/em&gt;. We don't need to understand what a "cat" is, what it means to be "red", or what exactly is meant by saying "Sam is a cat". Propositional Logic operates with no regard for any of this, and as a result, it can offer up the holy grail: absolute proofs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in doing so, it Propositional Logic sacrifices almost all meaning, and all connection to reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problems of applying Propositional Logic to the Bible (or any domain of human life) are apparent. Consider this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(A) Lambs have wool and four legs&lt;br/&gt;(B) Jesus is the Lamb&lt;br/&gt;(C) Jesus has wool and four legs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's clear that "Jesus is the Lamb" is a metaphor. Propositional Logic does not recognize metaphors. Try this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(A) Jesus is the Shepherd of the lambs&lt;br/&gt;(B) Jesus is the Lamb&lt;br/&gt;(C) Jesus is the Shepherd of himself&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we have clashing metaphors. Anyone who's ever tried to put together a biblical argument sees the shortfall here. Every statement the bible makes is contextual - every statement has to be interpreted. And Propositional Logic can't handle context.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn't just an issue with biblical metaphors. It's a conflict between the messy world of real life, and the confined world of Propositional Logic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So we need a better method of interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Science&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Science wrestles with a similar issue. No measurement is unambiguous, no measurement is without context, everything has to be understood within margins of error. But science does just fine by using its own approach: telling itself stories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is how science has always done it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Isaac Newton didn't prove anything when he offered up his theories about gravity. Instead, he offered a compelling story about how gravity and the universe worked. This story explained things so well, it quickly became popular. And the more tests were done, the more the story seemed to explain the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story explained a lot more than people had ever imagined &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; be explained. It explained the relationship between the planets in the sky, the earth, and an apple falling from a tree. And it did so in such a nice way, it became the dominant way of understanding the world for hundreds of years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But eventually, some details were discovered that didn't quite fit with Newton's story. And this made clear the need for a better, more complete, story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And so Einstein came along, with a crazy new story about how the universe worked - and it prevailed because it was a better story than anyone else could offer. It could explain why the measurements of the speed of light were always the same, when Newton's story suggested differently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because Einstein's story explained so much more, it became the dominant way in which scientists view the world. And to this day, no one's really offered a better story than Einstein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But is Einstein's story &lt;em&gt;true&lt;/em&gt; - absolutely and concretely?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only method science has for evaluating that is to look at how many details Einstein's story explains, and how many details it is forced to ignore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Einstein's story handles a lot of strange details. But if tomorrow, a whole new set of details began to be discovered, which were not explained in Einstein's story - the search would begin for a new story, a better way to explain it all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Bible&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is how we must approach the Bible. The Bible is full of statements that can be (and are) taken in hundreds or thousands of different ways. And there really is no end to this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We're never going to find a conclusive way of reading Jesus' command to eat his body, or Paul's statement about baptizing for the dead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What we have to look for is the better story, the narrative which explains each of these points in the entire context, and makes everything fit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We're not looking for the most common-sense story. We're not looking for the story which fits most with our preconceptions. Einstein's space-warping, time-bending theory didn't sound reasonable - but it explained the actual research better than anything had before. So we're looking for the story that makes the most sense of ALL the biblical statements, in the best possible way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we go on, we might have to refine this story over and over. We might realize that the story we've been using is really just a small part of a much bigger story, which explains everything and redefines our previous story. Sometimes we might realize the story we've been holding on to doesn't really explain much at all - and really doesn't fit very well with the text.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And so we'll begin the search for a new story - a bigger, better, more complete story - that explains things we never imagined &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; be explained.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2010/04/30/the-new-testament-message/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2010/04/30/the-new-testament-message/</link><pubDate>Fri Apr 30 23:46:24 CDT 2010</pubDate><title>The New Testament Message</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>There are many things I do not understand about the New Testament, and the mentality behind what the New Testament authors wrote.

And so Jesus' disciples went into the world proclaiming that sins had been forgiven, and inviting people to partake of the freedom that came with acknowledging that fact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Holding to an identity centered around following rules, adhering to physical rituals, or  being proud of certain accomplishments would result in slavery - because the human mind imposes standards on us that no one can actually live up to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But simply trusting what God had said and done, would release you to experience freedom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of Paul's talk about "faith" is usually misunderstood to be stating the importance of believing certain facts. But Paul means to say that trust in God is the only thing that is important - trusting in him as our source of identity, trusting in his forgiveness and grace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Salvation", for Paul, was trusting what God had done, and experiencing the freedom of that trust. When Paul writes to his converts, he states that God had removed the "consciousness of guilt" from their minds - not that God had removed the sins from his book in heaven (that was a given), but that God had worked in history to show them that their sins were gone. And when they recognized that fact, the freedom they experienced was a profound salvation.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/12/24/argument-basic-theism/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/12/24/argument-basic-theism/</link><pubDate>Mon Dec 24 01:00:33 CST 2012</pubDate><title>The argument for basic theism</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;in the sense that a Christian should not violently oppose those things. However, in the realm in which a Christian has direct influence, those things should not be happening.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don't think Paul would be much for protest. I think he would instead encourage acting in a way completely opposite to the way governments work, as a testimony to that alternative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/104954018205/permalink/10151424717413206/?comment_id=10151424746208206&amp;offset=0&amp;total_comments=10"&gt;https://www.facebook.com/groups/104954018205/permalink/10151424717413206/?comment_id=10151424746208206&amp;offset=0&amp;total_comments=10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/being-human/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/being-human/</link><pubDate>Mon May 11 11:01:06 CDT 2015</pubDate><title>Being Human</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>...</description><content:encoded>&lt;![CDATA[]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/the-creative-process-of-god/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/the-creative-process-of-god/</link><pubDate>Wed Jun 22 12:13:18 CDT 2016</pubDate><title>The Creative Process of God</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>For quite a while now, I’ve been suffering through something I might call *abstraction angst*.

It’s hard to describe to those who haven’t experienced it, but you might get a little of the flavor if you imagine working at a bank, handling thousands and thousands of dollars per day, then finding a dollar on the ground on your walk home. It’s not that you don’t appreciate the dollar—it’s just that it’s hard to think of it as mattering much. In fact, you might even be in a kind of &lt;a href="http://amzn.to/28NuPRG"&gt;Pursuit of Happyness&lt;/a&gt; situation, where that dollar actually makes a whole lot of difference—and &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; have trouble caring much about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; want to understand what I’m feeling, &lt;a href="http://worrydream.com/#!2/LadderOfAbstraction"&gt;this article by Bret Victor&lt;/a&gt; might get you significantly closer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Essentially, Bret Victor ascends the ladder of abstraction, so that he can program video games in a way that’s both interesting and challenging to human beings. In doing so, he moves farther and farther away from what it feels like to play a game, or even to think about a game, and moves into a territory where the game itself is just one of many points in possibility space. But once you’ve reached that level, creating the game is just a few choices on a grid of possibilities—it’s not much like the creative process. And then, when you play the game, you’re aware that you’re just exploring one of a number of different paths someone else laid out for you to experience. You’re not really bringing anything new into existence—you’re not doing something the game creators didn’t foresee. Your gameplay is just one of the many different possibilities explored by the creators of the game beforehand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I imagine this is what some people feel when contemplating a photo of earth from far away. How can life be significant, when it’s so incredibly small in the cosmic order of things?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a while now, that’s what life has felt like to me. Of course, I recognized it as a fallacy—I should still be able to enjoy life even if it’s possible to think about it from a great height, or from very far away. Or in my case, at a very high level of abstraction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But recognizing something as a fallacy, and &lt;em&gt;feeling&lt;/em&gt; it as a fallacy are two very different things. In part, the feeling is just from overwork, from focusing my mind too intently on intellectual challenges, and not spending enough time in the practical enjoyment of life. But getting out of that overwork rut is hard: I make a living by writing code, which is an incredibly abstract process, and I’m on a mission to work through a vast amount of philosophy, which is an incredibly abstract discipline, and my main form of self-expression is typing words onto a black screen, which is an abstract hobby if ever there was one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the things I’ve been thinking about lately is the trinity. I’ve been meaning to write something on it, and I’m sure I’ll get around to that eventually. The short story, though, is that although the trinity itself isn’t spelled out anywhere in the scriptures, from the earliest moments of Christian history, it was one of the most important and distinctive ideas in Christianity. Understanding why it became so important is itself quite an interesting story. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My take on it is that the trinity emerges from early Christian experience. As good monotheists, Christians experienced God as transcendent, mysterious, and unknowable. This is the position of much of philosophical theism: there must be a God, but its true nature must be forever beyond us. Christians affirmed this thought and this experience. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, Christians had experienced God in Jesus of Nazareth. In him, “the fullness of God dwelt bodily”, as they put it. They also affirmed this thought and this experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And they had also experienced God among themselves. When they were inspired, when they seemed to reach beyond their place and situation, and experience true brilliance of thought and word and action, when their community seemed to exhibit a creativity and order far beyond the norm—they could say that God was among them. They affirmed this thought and this experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trinity is simply the affirmation and description of these experiences. The experiences could not be simply conflated—experiencing the Spirit among you was not the same as knowing the absolutely transcendent mind of the Creator. But neither could they be completely separated—as a matter of faith, Jesus had revealed that the core identity of the transcendent Creator was love. And so the doctrine of the trinity was formulated to affirm that these things were distinct, but not separate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I bring this up because it seems to tell us something about the creative process. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the trinitarian doctrine of creation, God the Father creates the world, God the Son is embodied within it, and God the Spirit brings new life out of it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can think of God the Father as creating the world in an analytical and abstract way. It is a work of construction or programming or design. It is done &lt;em&gt;from the outside&lt;/em&gt;. But once created, the world is not complete until the Son can be incarnated within it. Then it can be experienced from &lt;em&gt;the inside&lt;/em&gt;. Then, according to Christian doctrine, God can truly understand us and relate to us as we are. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I find it interesting that humans are so obsessed with creating virtual worlds. We’ve been doing this from the moment we started telling stories, but now we do it across all kinds of media, from books to radio to movies to virtual reality. And one thing that seems to be universal, is that when we tell a story, we have the impulse to place ourselves within it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fan-fiction, this is called the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Sue"&gt;Mary Sue&lt;/a&gt;—the character whose sole reason for existence is so that &lt;em&gt;we&lt;/em&gt; (the authors or viewers) can see ourselves interacting with our heroes and favorite characters. But that’s a little dismissive—at some level, all stories are built so that we have a way of experiencing ourselves within them. With virtual reality, we now have the ability to do it almost literally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why do we have such a strong desire to inhabit our created worlds? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don’t think it’s because of the quality of experience. Many critics of virtual reality think we’re on a mission to escape real life for an experience that’s much more enjoyable. And yet virtual reality to date does not get anywhere close to the quality of real life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think it’s something deeper. I think, as creators, we have an impulse to incarnate within our creations. We are not drawn to virtual realities because they are better than our current experience, but because we have created them, and we are instinctively drawn to commune with our creation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It would seem that as creators of art, of words, of worlds, we find ourselves drawn into a trinitarian relationship with our creations. We create from a position of analytic and architectural abstraction, and then seek to experience our creations from the inside. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’ll notice that I left out the third member of the trinity. In western Christian thought, the Spirit proceeds “from the Father and the Son”. In the biblical account, once God has incarnated in the world, once both the Father and the Son are involved in the universe, then the Spirit is set loose in creation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where the Father creates analytically and architecturally, and the Son experiences that creation from within, the Spirit acts to bring forth new things from the life contained in creation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Spirit is not analytical, but emergent. The Spirit is in a sense the feedback loop of the Father and the Son, transforming and bringing forth the creative potential of existence, surprising and delighting all with new things that were completely unforeseen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my own creative experience, this feedback loop is absolutely necessary. When you create from a position of analysis and abstraction, you may create something that makes sense, but has no life. When you lose yourself in the experience, you may create something amateurish and unwieldy, like a Mary Sue character, or a tearjerking song that simply recites bad things that have happened to you. But when you can maintain both—when you can analyze and create and experience all at the same time—then you experience something like inspiration. Then you’re shocked to find things emerging that you never anticipated or planned or foreknew, things which are your own creations, and yet are the surprising and spontaneous creations of new life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I got there with my songwriting, when I was analyzing and crying and surprising myself all at the same time—that’s when I felt that the creative process was truly at work. That’s when I created the things I’m most proud of to this day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, I lost my songwriting ability. Where it had come naturally to me for years, it stopped coming. And I could tell that what I had done was to stray too far, and lose myself in analysis and abstraction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But analysis is not something you can undo, exactly. You can’t unsee the things that you’ve trained yourself to see. Trying to get myself to stop analyzing seemed even more hopeless and quixotic than anything else I had done. So eventually I gave up and moved on to other forms of self-expression. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a sense, I may now be at a similar place with life itself. Striving to analyze too much, and losing my ability to create. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But thinking about the trinity has changed my perspective on this. My problem is not that I have done too much analysis—it’s that I have done too little incarnation. I don’t need to try to stop analyzing, I need to learn to do more inhabiting. I need to analyze, create, and experience all at the same time. I need to create what I can simultaneously experience and enjoy. Only in doing so can I move out of abstraction angst, and move back towards understanding what things &lt;em&gt;feel like&lt;/em&gt;. Only in doing so can I generate the feedback loop that enables true creation to come into the world. Only in doing so can I rediscover and re-embrace life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m not absolutely sure what that looks like yet. But it gives me hope that the creative process isn’t doomed to self-destruction, that new things really are possible, and that abstraction doesn’t have to lead to nihilism—but when placed in its proper context, can lead to ever more beautiful art, music, stories, and worlds.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/christianity-and-transhumanism/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/christianity-and-transhumanism/</link><pubDate>Mon May 11 08:25:56 CDT 2015</pubDate><title>Christianity &amp; Transhumanism</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>What does Christianity have to say about radical life extension?

I think the term "simulation" is just a good starting point, not necessarily the best way to conceptualize what's going on. Similarly, thinking of God as "posthuman" may introduce all kinds of concepts that aren't really applicable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of the popular level discussions of the Simulation Argument have imagined our creators as being "teen gamers", or something similar, immature entities in possession of disproportionately massive tools. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But all evidence from our universe indicates that this existence is huge, consistent, and thorough. Our creator(s) are likely beings massively more complex than the universe we perceive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And at that scale, any concept of "artificiality" dissolves into the stretches of existence we're really dealing with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Originally posted:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/transfigurism/permalink/10152050657730436/?comment_id=10152052194845436&amp;offset=0&amp;total_comments=12"&gt;https://www.facebook.com/groups/transfigurism/permalink/10152050657730436/?comment_id=10152052194845436&amp;offset=0&amp;total_comments=12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2008/09/08/quality-of-light/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2008/09/08/quality-of-light/</link><pubDate>Mon Sep 08 20:35:51 CDT 2008</pubDate><title>Quality of Light</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>I was walking down the block to check my mail, and I noticed the light.

So, with a lunch bag (read, plastic Walmart bag) tied to my belt, I headed out, scouting out local shops and stores, climbing up and down some strange land formations, jumping fences, and the like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I realized a profound thing: our world is no longer made for people. It's made for cars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://bp2.blogger.com/_RkQnU8sPjpM/Rugq2QojhyI/AAAAAAAAABA/h3TjGqSuIjo/s1600-h/PICT0586.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="float:left;cursor:pointer;margin:0 10px 10px 0;" src="http://bp2.blogger.com/_RkQnU8sPjpM/Rugq2QojhyI/AAAAAAAAABA/h3TjGqSuIjo/s320/PICT0586.JPG" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;And this led me to decide to venture behind Walmart itself. Now, venturing behind any big store always feels a little bit like trespassing to me, so I was cautious. But when I got behind Walmart, I discovered a giant man-made "mountain". This mountain was designed, I decided, to segregate the nice neighborhoods from the sounds of Walmart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align:left;"&gt;So I decided to scale it. Admittedly, it's not much of a mountain, only about twice as tall as Walmart. And in the photos, it doesn't look too steep. But it is covered with tall, dense vegetation that makes it hard to walk, and makes you feel like little crawly things are latching onto your skin with every step. And it &lt;span style="font-style:italic;"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; harder to walk up than it looks.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_RkQnU8sPjpM/RugrOwojhzI/AAAAAAAAABI/zrfRb_SA8OY/s1600-h/noname%286%29.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="float:right;cursor:pointer;margin:0 0 10px 10px;" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_RkQnU8sPjpM/RugrOwojhzI/AAAAAAAAABI/zrfRb_SA8OY/s320/noname%286%29.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Once on top, I got an unique view of both the miles and miles of retail and road, and the interesting society of Walmart. As soon as I got to the top, I heard sirens wailing, and a big fire truck pulled up behind Walmart. Firemen poured out and into the rear of the building, leaving the truck itself deserted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After watching this scene for a while and moving around the park-like environment on top of this mountain, I decided to come back down by a different way, and walked back through the parking lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That was when I got a call telling me that Walmart hadn't even been able to get the wheels off of my car.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_RkQnU8sPjpM/RugsDwojh1I/AAAAAAAAABY/sb05_4X67HA/s1600-h/noname%283%29.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;margin:0 auto 10px;" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_RkQnU8sPjpM/RugsDwojh1I/AAAAAAAAABY/sb05_4X67HA/s320/noname%283%29.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_RkQnU8sPjpM/Rugsmwojh2I/AAAAAAAAABg/MinlOAEzIWw/s1600-h/noname%287%29"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;margin:0 auto 10px;" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_RkQnU8sPjpM/Rugsmwojh2I/AAAAAAAAABg/MinlOAEzIWw/s320/noname%287%29" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2006/05/07/clouds-mp3-2/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2006/05/07/clouds-mp3-2/</link><pubDate>Sun May 07 17:37:00 CDT 2006</pubDate><title>Clouds MP3</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>Listen to the newly recorded version of Clouds:Stream it-micah...</description><content:encoded>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Listen to the newly recorded version of Clouds:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.reddingbrothers.com/sound/full/clouds.mp3"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.reddingbrothers.com/sound/stream/clouds.m3u"&gt;Stream it&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-micah&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2007/08/30/detaining-a-criminal-the-life-of-micah/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2007/08/30/detaining-a-criminal-the-life-of-micah/</link><pubDate>Thu Aug 30 17:58:00 CDT 2007</pubDate><title>Detaining a Criminal - the Life of Micah</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>In my bio, I refer to a time when I detained a criminal while waiting for the police to arrive.

I was recently asked for details about this incident, so I thought I would convey the story. A warning: I didn't use any physical violence to detain this criminal, so none of my celebrated hand-to-hand combat skills are described here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;The STORY about The CRIMINAL...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was working at Motel 6 in Everett, WA during a Summer break. My boss lived in the Motel, and would watch me on camera from time to time without me knowing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I was checking in this one lady, when I received a phone call. I picked it up, and it was from my manager.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Don't let her go!" she exclaimed. "The police are on their way, and they need you to detain her so she can't get into a room. They've asked for our help in capturing her."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Ok," I answered, and mimicked having a full conversation with a customer before hanging up the phone. It didn't occur to me that everyone was wanting me to be the one staying in danger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I took my time checking her in, and when she had a request for something to be changed, I told her I wasn't sure if I could do that. I took my time fumbling around and acting incompetent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I finally finished with her, I gave her the keys to get in her room. She walked out the door and into the hands of the just-arriving police force.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I am a nice guy, I gave her a refund on her rooms before they took her away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Later on, a bank robber hid out in our motel and the police surrounded us, but that's another story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-micah&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2005/06/01/another-night/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2005/06/01/another-night/</link><pubDate>Wed Jun 01 03:58:00 CDT 2005</pubDate><title>Another Night...</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>On Monday I hit the open mic at Bluebird Cafe, which is famous in Nashville, and played Abbey Road and Mr Rogers.

And to have this be perfectly fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm a long way from this becoming a reality. My car needs a key to start it, my house needs a key in order for me to get back in, and places of business want me to pay them using something tangible - like cash or a debit card. But I have made a lot of progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To start with, I don't carry a wallet. Instead, I use a rubber band or Ouchless hairband (these work great!) to wrap up a couple of cards in my back pocket. It's so much slimmer than a wallet, and it encourages me to think hard about what I actually carry back there. Most days I carry two cards - my ID and my debit card. Today is unusual, and for some reason I happen to be carrying an insurance card and a My Panera card.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do I get away with so few cards? Prioritize - and cheat. Ninety percent of the time I'm away from the house, the only card I need is my debit card. My driver's license, on the other hand, is pretty essential for legal reasons - even though I almost never need it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the rest of my cards can be tossed. Kroger Plus card? I memorize the phone number it's linked to. I can type it in at the register, and never scan a thing. Library card? I store the number in my phone - the librarians will happily forgo using the physical item. In fact, now that I've got an iPhone, I can store an unlimited number of barcodes, and pull them up as I need to. I use the myWallet app for this purpose. Even places that don't provide you a handy member number usually allow you to access your membership info through some other means - like the driver's license you're already carrying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I do have a school ID badge, and a gym passkey. These things actually need to be present to be used, so they're on a lanyard that I keep in my car. Since I only take my car to either of those places, I don't need to carry them on me personally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I carry two cards in my back pocket bound together with a hair-band. But what about keys?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've narrowed my keys down to 3 - one for my house, one each for my two cars. Until yesterday, I actually had two key-rings, each with just two keys: a house key and a car key. Since I only left the house with one specific car, I didn't need to carry the other car key with me. Today, I'm carrying all 3 keys, because keeping up with two sets has gotten a little silly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But I refuse to use a regular key-ring. Metal key-rings are hard to use, and refuse to fold flat in your pocket. So I replaced mine with the afore-mentioned Ouchless hair-band. I simply ripped one apart at the glued seam, fed it through the keys, and then tied it back together. It folds completely flat, takes up no space, and is easy to handle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://res.cloudinary.com/micahredding/image/upload/v1453072535/2010-02-16-keyring.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="size-medium wp-image-365 alignright" title="2010-02-16-keyring" src="http://res.cloudinary.com/micahredding/image/upload/v1453072536/2010-02-16-keyring-e1266359922389-300x225.jpg" alt="My ouchless key-ring" width="300" height="225" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I still have one problem: the keys themselves are thicker than need be. In the past, I've gone to walmart, and gotten copies made without the rubberized grips. By slimming down to metal-only keys, I can get my pocket feeling almost empty. Since I've recently traded out cars, I'm back to carrying rubberized keys - for the time being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For what it's worth, the keys go in the right pocket, since I'll most likely be opening the driver-side door with my right hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And in my left pocket...the iPhone. I thought I could never carry an iPhone because of its bulk. Before the iPhone, I had a slightly older Motorola Razr. I resisted upgrading, because Motorola actually started making their phones a little bigger after a while. But eventually, I had to get something new, and the new Razr was not that much smaller than an iPhone. And the iPhone's sheer usefulness has justified its size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of the iPhone, I no longer carry a voice recorder (used for songwriting), or a camera (kept on my belt when I toured the Middle East), or a notepad. And I'm beginning to be able to avoid carrying a laptop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I do carry my laptop, I carry it in a satchel that can hold the computer itself, the power cord, a notebook, headphones, and an iPhone syncing cable in a very compact space. But I increasingly want to go without it. And in order to do that, I have to have access to my files.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, the iPhone provides lots of options in that department. I personally use &lt;a href="https://www.dropbox.com/referrals/NTE5NDM3ODA5"&gt;Dropbox&lt;/a&gt; to hold 2 gigabytes of my files &lt;em&gt;for free&lt;/em&gt;, synced and backed up online. I can access it from my computer, from the web, or from my phone. (Do click on that link and join for free, because I get extra storage space if you do!) It's the best tool I've ever encountered for protecting and freeing your files, and it just works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rest of my data is backed up online with &lt;a href="http://www.jungledisk.com"&gt;JungleDisk&lt;/a&gt;, which is more convoluted, but allows an unlimited amount of storage. It costs money, but also provides a way to access my data from anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I'm getting there. My pockets are very slim, but they're not yet empty. When they can finally be empty, and everything still work just as well, then I will be in paradise.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2004/09/25/rendezvous-performance-in-teays-valley-friday-92404/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2004/09/25/rendezvous-performance-in-teays-valley-friday-92404/</link><pubDate>Sat Sep 25 02:30:00 CDT 2004</pubDate><title>Rendezvous performance in Teays Valley - Friday 9/24/04</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>9/24/04 - The concert that almost didn't happen.

First of all, electricity went down all over town, taking out traffic lights, convenience stores, and half of the venue! Traffic was a nightmare, half the coffeeshop was dark, and only half of the regular menu of drinks could be made. Then, it got worse. ALL the electricity went out. We were gearing up to perform in the dark, when Gabe declared loudly, "This is not my fault!", and the electricity spontaneously came on all over town.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The subsequent concert was upbeat, a little bit crazy, and fun as usual (for us, anyway).&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2010/04/16/the-structure-of-human-hope/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2010/04/16/the-structure-of-human-hope/</link><pubDate>Fri Apr 16 18:23:55 CDT 2010</pubDate><title>The Structure of Human Hope</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>There are many philosophies of the future, many perspectives on how society progresses, and many thoughts on what gives us hope.

When hope fails, people die shortly thereafter. Unfortunately, many of the philosophies that have flourished in the last 100 years have seemed intent on offering nothing but despair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are good reasons for that, and many of these philosophies are based on a straight-forward reading of science. Alternative philosophies offer us hope - but only through the expensive move of escapism, leaving us feeling like our efforts in the world are pointless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frankly, I don't have the space to deal with these issues. Instead, I want to offer what I see as the only viewpoint that is capable of giving us hope and confidence, and simultaneously keeping us engaged with the world. That viewpoint will allow us to engage in a radical way, speaking prophetically to corruption and oppression, never once giving in to despair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, we must view the world and the universe as deeply &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; - as filled with wonder and glory. We must view ourselves as intimately connected with everyone on earth. We must see ourselves as interconnected and intertwined in society as a whole. This will allow us to empathize, to understand, and to approach issues systemically, rather than through finger-pointing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, we will not minimize the issues there are. Many people and institutions live in complete denial of the reality they find themselves in. As such, they oppress others, they shrug off responsibility, they destroy people's lives and efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And this brings us to the main dynamic: there is a reality that WILL persist, regardless of what currently stands against it. The reality of unity, of empathy, of equality, will &lt;em&gt;ultimately and always&lt;/em&gt; prevail. And since this is so, we can confidently stand against forces of oppression and injustice, knowing that their time is short.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not blind optimism, leading to laziness. The downfall of oppression will happen through &lt;em&gt;our&lt;/em&gt; efforts, not independent of real-world work. But this also does not rely entirely on our own abilities. As we work to resist oppression, to undo the forces of violence, we have a powerful weapon on our side...and that weapon is &lt;em&gt;reality&lt;/em&gt;. Because we are working to bring the world in to conformity to the glorious reality the lies beneath it, we can and should expect amazing and miraculous things to happen. It is as if we are chipping away at a block of ice, until we suddenly find an avalanche breaking free, spontaneously multiplying our efforts thousands upon thousands of times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can see that the world is good, that reality is wondrous, that oppression is real, that our work matters, that we are not alone in our efforts, and that change and justice will come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it is also important to realize something else. The setting-to-right of an issue in the world does not bring about the end of our work. There is no utopia. There is only ever-increasing growth and realization, as each achievement and victory brings us to higher and higher planes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We should be glad for this. If utopia was achieved, we would soon settle into complacency, and then turn again to despair. But if there was no movement and no progress, we would have little hope or inspiration, and would again be left with only despair. Only perpetual movement and progress can give us meaning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, this progress is not straight and uniform. There are abrupt changes, hurdles to overcome, and dramatic reversals. But we can know that our work is building, that the things we do today truly change the world, and that the results of our efforts will last forever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which brings us to the big-picture view. Eschatology often presents us with one, final end, in which utopia is achieved. But for the reasons given above, this view is not realistic. If we achieved a utopian heaven, we would soon despair of doing nothing, and our heaven would become a hell. In any view of the future, we must look for an ever-growing, ever-changing existence - or existence becomes meaningless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I believe in this: Society must continually grow and progress, upwards to infinity. So must each individual. Time is infinite. Growth is infinite. And together, as societies and individuals, we will grow upwards and outwards into the infinite fullness of reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This, alone, seems to me a real basis of human hope.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/03/05/arguing-about-bible/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/03/05/arguing-about-bible/</link><pubDate>Mon Mar 05 07:53:26 CST 2012</pubDate><title>Arguing about the Bible</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>I grew up arguing about the bible.

What if the other side is right?” There is no real escape from those questions. It might always be that the blindness and ignorance we're accusing the other side of, is really most present in us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or more likely, is present in both sides. Present in all people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deeper you go into those questions, the more you realize that humility is needed. &lt;em&gt;Do unto others&lt;/em&gt; comes frighteningly alive, as you contemplate your own words being thrown back at you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you follow that trail long enough, you might decide that there is &lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/02/29/morality-rational-and-how-we-shape-meaning-void"&gt;very little&lt;/a&gt; we can really know. And you would be right. If you really follow it, you might find yourself without much of anything left, holding onto to nothing but your sense of self. And that sense of self will probably be crumbling, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But then you come face to face with your own impulses. And you realize that what is needed is not certainty, but action. And so you begin to rebuild.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Action comes first. Action is real.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then comes behavior, action seen at a distance, and principles, the action of the mind, and beliefs, the projection of our actions onto the cosmos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then we realize the richness of what we have to draw from. No longer do we have to arm-wrestle over small interpretations like our lives are on the line. Stories shape our understanding of ourselves, words ignite our imaginations to new possibilities, we begin to understand that inspired writing is more than just factually correct, it is writing that turns our minds to action, to cutting through the indecisiveness, and taking steps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the dirt up, everything is reconfigured, everything is illuminated. Real people did real things, and we are real people doing real things after them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no way to end this or wrap it up. It’s simply that you act, and continue to act. It’s that you realize everything has meaning when it translates to concrete reality. That when we’re talking in grandiose words about abstract worlds, that it all comes down to sweat and blood and dirt and food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that’s worth arguing about. &lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2006/12/21/baptism-and-eschatology-and-70-ad/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2006/12/21/baptism-and-eschatology-and-70-ad/</link><pubDate>Thu Dec 21 20:26:00 CST 2006</pubDate><title>Baptism and Eschatology and 70 AD</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>In 1Corinthians 10, Paul compared the post-Exodus Israelites to the first century Christians.

His point was to warn of the danger of falling away, and to warn that falling away was a present reality, just as it was for the Israelites post-Exodus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He pointed out that the Israelites had been led out of Egypt and then "baptized into Moses" by the cloud and the sea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whenever we see the phrase "baptized into" in the New Testament, it refers to a process of pledging oneself. John "baptized into" repentance; that is, the people he was baptizing were pledging themselves to repentance. He also "baptized into" forgiveness; the people were being baptized to identify that they had been forgiven, or that they were seeking forgiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jesus talks about being "baptized into" the Father, the Son, and the holy Spirit. Paul talks about being "baptized into" the death of Christ. Each of these refer to identifying or pledging oneself to a certain cause or individual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Peter speaks on Pentecost, he does the same thing. "Change your minds, and be BAPTIZED in the name of Jesus Christ INTO the forgiveness of your sins." These people were being "baptized into" forgiveness (the same as with John) identifying themselves with Jesus and the forgiveness he brought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when Paul speaks in 1Corinthians 10 about being "baptized into" Moses, he is not focusing on the water aspects of passing through the Red Sea. He is saying that the Israelites had pledged themselves to Moses by following him through the Red Sea, and by following the cloud of God's glory. By doing so, they had left their old lives behind, utterly and completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the sequence is as follows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Passover occured in an event symbolizing the purchase of their lives. Moses then led the people out of Egypt in the beginning of the Exodus. When they got to the Red Sea, the people followed Moses through it, fully cementing their identification with him, and their rejection of their old lives. They then began a period of 40 years of wilderness wandering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paul's comparison of the First Century Christians to the ancient Israelites is rife with symbolism.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They too had witnessed a Passover, with Jesus the Messiah as the sacrificial lamb purchasing their lives. They too had been baptized to identify themselves with Jesus and his new movement, and in rejection of their former lives. They too had entered a 40 year period of persecution and struggle. Paul warns that they too could fall back into their old ways, and end up being destroyed as the ancient Israelites were. But if they persevered, they too would eventually enter into the Promised Land.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In making this comparison, Paul revealed a lot about First Century baptism. It was a pledge and identification with Jesus. It both symbolically and actually closed the doors on their old lives, because identifying with Jesus meant rejection by your friends, family, and the religious establishment. Baptism meant entering into the 40 years of persecution and rejection from those you had known.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only one generation of Israelites were "baptized in the cloud and the sea". Future generations made their pledges to God in other ways; but this one historic action had ramifications for the entire future of the nation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a similar way, first century Christians who publicly identified with Jesus through baptism established themselves as a counter-cultural force whose actions and story would reverberate down through the ages. The way God dealt with this publicly identified group would send a message to the rest of the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When God vindicated these Christians in 70CE, their public identification with Jesus changed from a mark of persecution to a mark of triumph, and sent a clear message about God's nature ringing down the halls of history.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Without the public identification of that chosen generation, the victory of Jesus would have been vague and indistinct. But by choosing to publicly identify and suffer with Jesus, that generation established an object lesson for all time, and achieved a stunning vindication.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That was the purpose of baptism.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2010/04/18/the-structure-of-human-hope-personal-eschatology/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2010/04/18/the-structure-of-human-hope-personal-eschatology/</link><pubDate>Sun Apr 18 12:49:07 CDT 2010</pubDate><title>The Structure of Human Hope: personal eschatology</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>As I've hinted in my previous posts (1, 2), I think God means that there is progress and growth for infinity, that our efforts and actions reverberate down through eternity, and that there are always ...</description><content:encoded>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;As I've hinted in my previous posts (&lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/2010/04/16/the-structure-of-human-hope/"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/2010/04/16/the-structure-of-human-hope-in-the-first-century/"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;), I think &lt;em&gt;God&lt;/em&gt; means that there is progress and growth for infinity, that our efforts and actions reverberate down through eternity, and that there are always new things to learn and achieve. To me, this is what it means to believe in a personal, theistic God. Certainly other theologies suggest different scenarios - scenarios where in the end, everything we've done simply dissolves back into the emptiness from which it came. Those theologies are legitimate, but I would question whether they are theistic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In broad form, here is what I perceive as the theistic view. There is a reality which underlies the world we see. That reality is firm and solid, and has consequences. Through history, that reality continues to be brought more fully into view, and the forces which stand against that reality (violence, oppression, slavery, hatred) ultimately collapse, either slowly and peacefully, or quickly and dramatically. And so, as each obstacle is overcome, we grow unendingly upwards and onwards toward unification with that ultimate reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This identifies both the cause and the direction of change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's why this is important. For hope to be real, it must be the case that things will get better. But this can't be an immutable progress that happens with or without us, leading to laziness and resignation. Instead, it must be a progress that is built with our efforts, upon the work of countless others before us - a participatory growth. It must, in fact, be in participation with the underlying nature of the universe itself - co-creation with God. Without that, our obstacles will begin to seem insurmountable. But if indeed things are getting better, there are only three ultimate endings: things eventually revert back to decay, things finally reach a utopia, or growth continues forever. And I would argue that only the last one offers an ultimately real hope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many of us, the idea of society progressing without end is only comforting if we get to be part of it. But very few philosophies offer us any real chance of being involved - either we die and are gone, or we get resurrected into a changeless heaven. A third alternative being proposed recently in books such as "Surprised by Hope" by NT Wright, is that we are eventually physically resurrected and the earth is transformed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This third alternative has the benefit of having us back involved in the progression of human society. But, at least in the way it is being imagined, it leaves a lot to be desired. It foresees an eternity of existence in a still-limited body. It requires God to step in and recreate the earth. It relies on a misreading of the New Testament, seeing it primarily concerned with changing the physical universe, rather than a more audience-relevant transition between covenants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think we need to do what the New Testament seems to: strike a very delicate position. The way I read it, the New Testament is almost entirely focused on the horizon of the first century. Jesus affirms the resurrection, but does so in an unusual way. In Luke 20:38, Jesus says, "[God] is not the God of the dead, but of the living, for to him all are alive."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jesus seems to connect resurrection, not to a specific event, nor to an immortal soul, but to the all-knowledge of God.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This, to me, is pretty profound, and needs to be the basis for a re-thinking of the ideas of immortality and resurrection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the book of Revelation mentions very little about resurrection - focusing instead on the vindication of the oppressed, and the downfall of the oppressors. The only real mentions seem to be an intriguing statement about deeds following the dead, and the scene often called "the final judgment".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, Revelation 14:13:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Then I heard a voice from heaven say, "Write: Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on."&lt;br/&gt;"Yes," says the Spirit, "they will rest from their labor, for their deeds will follow them."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My initial interpretation is that this is describing a "before", during which people's deeds are a barrier between themselves and God (going before them), and an "after", during which people's deeds no longer separate them from God (trailing behind them).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, Revelation 20:12-15:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;And I saw the dead, great and small, standing before the throne, and books were opened. Another book was opened, which is the book of life. The dead were judged according to what they had done as recorded in the books. The sea gave up the dead that were in it, and death and Hades gave up the dead that were in them, and each person was judged according to what he had done. Then death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. The lake of fire is the second death. If anyone's name was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The focus here is on judgment, on the one hand, and on the abolishment of death, on the other. While we have the wicked being dismissed, we do not have a similarly concrete statement about those in the book of life. Whereas in Jesus' parable of the sheep and the goats, he invited the sheep to enter in, there is no such invitation here. All that is really said is that death and Hades are burned up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To me, these passages seem to leave a lot of questions about the afterlife and resurrection. Revelation seems to be telling us that barriers between man and God are being removed ("death and Hades", and whatever was letting deeds proceed people), not describing the actual ramifications and effects of that removal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we triangulate with a third scripture, then we end up with an interesting picture. In 1 Corinthians 15:54-57, Paul says:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;When the perishable has been clothed with the imperishable, and the mortal with immortality, then the saying that is written will come true: "Death has been swallowed up in victory."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Where, O death, is your victory? Where, O death, is your sting?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law. But thanks be to God! He gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He seems to be saying that the physical body does not need to be removed in order to become immortal, but instead will be "clothed" in immortality. And the way in which this happens is that death is overcome by the removal of sin, and sin is overcome by the removal of the Law, and the Law is overcome through Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we can assume that these passages are talking about connected things, then it seems like Paul says death is overcome when the Law is removed, and Revelation points to the victory over death and Hades as the removal of the separation between God and man (one's deeds no longer precede them, getting in the way). And Jesus points to immortality as being known, having a certain relationship with, God.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So it seems like the focus of these scriptures is on a resurrection event as the removal of certain relational barriers, not specifics of the timing or nature of personal immortality. It seems like the scriptures are not telling us &lt;em&gt;about&lt;/em&gt; immortality or the afterlife, but telling us that we can rely on our confidence in the power and knowledge of God.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, the scriptures seem to be about the removal of fear. And the way that is portrayed in the New Testament is a two-fold process, through the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus, and then through the removal of the Law and the institutions of condemnation that surrounded it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So then, we should be really hesitant about looking to the scriptures to understand the nature of resurrection. We should instead look to the scriptures for the kind of confidence Jesus demonstrated on the cross, trusting himself to God and his love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jesus' confidence was rewarded in an extremely unusual way - a bodily resurrection less than three days later. This isn't what we expect for ourselves, but it should push us in the direction of thinking that whatever happens, it may be unexpected and unusual, but always flows from the love and power of God.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As society moves forward, finding itself more and more in touch with the reality that lies beneath it, we should expect to see the glory and power of God more and more. And as that happens, we can be confident that in ways surprising and unexpected, God will be protecting, preserving, and restoring us, never letting us go, because to him, nothing is lost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though we do not know in what way things are being preserved, we can know that they are safe. And though we do not know in what way they may re-appear to us, we can know that we will indeed see them again - because to God, and increasingly to us, all are alive.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/04/30/maybe-i-was-wrong/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/04/30/maybe-i-was-wrong/</link><pubDate>Mon Apr 30 21:05:04 CDT 2012</pubDate><title>Maybe I was wrong</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>For several years now, I've argued that everything in the bible was completely fulfilled and finished almost two thousand years ago.

And when I began to notice that this &lt;em&gt;one big cataclysmic event&lt;/em&gt; was both expected and experienced in the first century, I assumed that that was it, and the whole thing was done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, I'm seeing that it's a &lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/04/16/his-enemies-beneath-his-feet"&gt;bit more complicated&lt;/a&gt; than that. Both Paul and the author of Revelation specifically talk about a "three-part" set of events, a set of events that seem to stretch beyond the first century and into our future. My CoC perspective kept those things collapsed into one single happening for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But more significant than any timeline is an understanding of what was to happen when the &lt;em&gt;one big cataclysmic event&lt;/em&gt; was over. The disciples assumed that this was when they would begin to reign with Jesus over the nations; and Jesus didn't correct them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They would begin to rule, and that rule would increase without end. But ruling in Christianity always comes in the form of heroic sacrifice. And so, in the dust of the first century cataclysm, Jesus' disciples went out in the world to demolish kingdoms and empires and vast institutions of slavery…by sacrificing their lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And their heroic sacrifices succeeded. So much that Rome itself tried desperately to get access to the power they were exercising. Unfortunately for Rome, you don't get such power by painting your shields with a cross.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first Christians saw this power as increasing without end, drawing all of creation into the life of God.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ultimate extension of this, the outer edge of the New Testament's vision, is the final and complete defeat of death for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The defeat of death for the first Christians happened when they saw death overcome by compassion. Their confidence in this allowed them to face down all kinds of opponents, dangers, and threats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But for the rest of the world, death is ongoing. They are imprisoned by fear, by anger, by hate. And when this finally changes, when the world wakes up to the reality that is here, then they too will escape the slavery of death, and death will be totally destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The way we get there is through participating in the reign of Christ, sacrificing ourselves to spread the message of truth and love.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2004/11/10/newsflash-special-duet-performance-with-micah-josiah/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2004/11/10/newsflash-special-duet-performance-with-micah-josiah/</link><pubDate>Wed Nov 10 21:09:00 CST 2004</pubDate><title>NEWSFLASH - Special duet performance with Micah &amp; Josiah</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>As some of you may know, a few weeks ago Gabe took a trip to Seattle, WA to visit some friends of ours.

Why does that solve it, or tell us anything about it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first glance, it may not help much. After all, if there are an infinite number of worlds with different histories than ours, we must assume that the amount of evil and suffering in creation is not just huge, but infinite. God created trillions of human beings only to suffer through short and horrific lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the key thing about the multiverse is what it tells us about God's nature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why did God create anything? The traditional answer has been that he wanted something to love, or that his essence is creation. He had to display his All-Loving nature by creating finite beings to express his love through and towards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this is correct. God has an innate desire to express his love through creation. And look at how abundantly he did this! He didn't just create another intelligent being to discourse with, he created a whole chain of creatures from bacteria to land animals to sea creatures, from birds to plants to the cosmos itself. He built a universe 20-billion light years across, and as far as we can tell, we're the only intelligent life-form in it. How wasteful! And yet, to God this is not waste. It's creation. It's creativity. It's love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;God's love is expressed in the existence of bacteria, which will never know him, just as it is in the existence of humans, who have the opportunity to be like him. God's love and majesty is expressed in 20 billion light-years worth of intricately shaped rock, dust, gases, stars and galaxies, just as it is in the crumbling of a small piece of sandstone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And God's creative love, we have now discovered, is even more infinite than we thought. God didn't just create an enormous beautiful universe for us to inhabit; he did it trillions of times over, for different people and different creatures, with different structures and different patterns, holding different beautiful things we cannot fathom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We should not recoil in horror at this image. We should stand back in awe at the creative work of God.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And this gives us a crucial insight into God. For the God we love and worship holds the suffering of his creation to be serious indeed. The rape of a poor woman, the torture of a Jew, even the unhappiness of a child, are serious things to our God.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because he is All-Loving, there is only one thing that he could hate worse than the suffering of his children: their non-existence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I was 15 years old, I was in a bike accident, and busted out my front tooth. I ended up with 15 stitches INSIDE my mouth, and some pretty impressive scarring on the outside. Because of that accident, I went through months and months adjusting to the replacement that had been made for me. I got used to eating again. Then, in examining my mouth, the doctors discovered that I had four extra teeth growing under my normal bottom teeth, a pretty rare situation in humans. That was only one of a host of different odd situations that happened in this process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's certainly conceivable that this experience affected my confidence and personality as I finished high school and went on to college. It would be hard to assess whether this effect was positive or negative, but it definitely had an effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due to having this experience, a host of other experiences resulted, including specific conversations I had with people that are very memorable to me. The chain of events leading from that one event grew and grew, including the one where I am writing about it now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If that one event had never happened, some parts of my life would have turned out very different. I would have different memories, a somewhat different personality, and a slightly different set of pyschological tools to work with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would be a different person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not as different as, say, two random strangers walking down the street. But different enough. More different than the difference between my teenage self and my adult self. If I could meet this alternate self, we would have different memories and experiences to discuss; some shared thoughts, but also some different thoughts. We would recognize that we were indeed different people. We would even look slightly different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But according to physics, this other self DOES exist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make no mistake - busting out my front tooth was suffering. Relatively minor suffering, but suffering nevertheless. The God who numbers our very hairs knows about this suffering. He empathizes with it. He felt it when it happened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And he could have stopped it from happening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But consider our two Micahs - one who got a busted tooth, one who didn't. Which does God love more? Which does God value having?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doesn't God value both of us the same? Doesn't God love the version of me who got his face busted just as much as he loves the version of me who didn't?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So which one would he create?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If God was choosing to create the universe, and he could choose to create one in which I never had that experience, or one in which I did have that experience, which would he choose? I think we can now see the answer to that. God would look at the results of these two possible universes, and see people he loves just as intensely as he ever loved anything. And instead of choosing only one of these people to exist, he would express his infinite love by creating BOTH.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Truth be told, God had the option of creating a universe where no evil existed. In fact, he DID create that universe. That universe does not hold you and me, however. It probably does not even hold anyone like you or me. It is a world without suffering, but also a world without &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;us&lt;/span&gt;. Without sin and evil, the genealogies that led to us never happened. God hates the sin and evil that have existed in our history, but he would hate our non-existence more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And so God also created other universes, universes which contain you and me, and every version of you and me that is possible. God's love for his creation is so intense, he could not stand to let any possible creature miss its chance for existence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When God began to create, he got to choose which universes (which histories) he would actualize. And from his perspective, the only choice was which of &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;us&lt;/span&gt; got to exist. Which of his children would &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;live&lt;/span&gt;? The good and unbroken, undamaged ones? Or the broken, suffering, victimized ones? The ones who never had a moment's worry? Or the ones who underwent unfathomable suffering?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If God had chosen just one universe out of the many, we would have a legitimate question: why this one? Why actualize all this suffering?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the fact that God chose ALL reveals to us his overall nature: unfathomable love expressed in the infinite act of creation, the act of creating brokenness as well as wholeness, health as well as sickness, evil as well as good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because God is love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Part &lt;a href="/blog/2007/05/27/the-problem-of-evil-part-1-the-unanswered-question"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="/blog/2007/06/03/the-problem-of-evil-part-2-the-multiverse-vs-gnosticism"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="/blog/2007/06/03/the-problem-of-evil-part-3-and-god-saw-the-multiverse-and-it-was-good"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2007/08/08/the-most-basic-human-desire/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2007/08/08/the-most-basic-human-desire/</link><pubDate>Wed Aug 08 17:48:00 CDT 2007</pubDate><title>The Most Basic Human Desire</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>The most basic human desire is to "have" another person, to possess the essence of someone else.But you can't.You can come close sometimes.

You can have a best friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But children grow up and grow apart from you, couples feel more or less connected at different times, and friends don't stay the same forever. People change, and the fleeting feeling of being strongly connected to another person comes and goes. But it rarely stays long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the most universal feelings is that of unrequited love; a feeling which hinges on seeing someone and desiring the essence of that person. In desiring that person's uniqueness, there is no remedy in finding someone else. Only that one person can fill that desire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes this desire becomes sinister. When it becomes twisted and unhealthy, it turns into jealousy, sexual disorders, obsession and stalking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other times it turns into love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing really fulfills it, though. Nothing quenches that thirst, because nothing can. No one can possess someone else, no matter how much you befriend them, bend them to your will, or engage them in relationship.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But there is still something about "having" someone else, because there is something in the human consciousness that stands in awe, and recoils in fear, from the wholly other. And deep in our psyche, we realize that every other person IS other than "I". Every other person has an experience and a consciousness so different, so multifaceted, that we cannot help but be drawn to it. We cannot help but desire it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is what I perceive as the ultimate aim of human life: to contemplate and reach for the beauty and glorious perplexity of the consciousness that is other than our own.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2005/05/02/movie-my-house-in-umbria/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2005/05/02/movie-my-house-in-umbria/</link><pubDate>Mon May 02 10:03:00 CDT 2005</pubDate><title>MOVIE - My House in Umbria</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>Dumb.

I've rid myself of lots of things, moved a lot of stuff from my house into a storage unit (then cleaned out the storage unit), weeded out clothes and sentimental items and packed and re-packed and sorted and re-sorted and condensed and compressed...and I &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; have too much stuff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But I think I've finally arrived at the point of seeing what it is that I want to &lt;em&gt;keep&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe that's a better place to be - knowing what I want, instead of what I don't want. Maybe minimalism suffers from too much focus on the negatives, instead of focusing on the core, letting the extraneous fall away. Maybe the exertion of getting rid of stuff is too exhausting, while the exercise of choosing your foundation is freeing and invigorating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe, rather than minimalism or enough-ism or appropriatism or whatever-ism, we should just know what we want.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forget the major house-cleaning and de-cluttering and tips and tricks and so on and so forth. Find what you like, hone in on that, and trust the rest to take care of itself. Focus on the core of what you want and value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or go back to de-cluttering. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;--&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So here's &lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/2011/10/29/what-i-want-my-backpack"&gt;what I want in my backpack&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2007/04/29/10-steps-to-enjoying-your-life/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2007/04/29/10-steps-to-enjoying-your-life/</link><pubDate>Sun Apr 29 03:49:00 CDT 2007</pubDate><title>10 Steps to Enjoying Your Life</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>So I've been mulling over how it is that someone can make sure they enjoy their life.

Here are my best guesses at the moment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Learn to play an instrument. Guitar or piano always make great conversation starters, especially if you don't come from a hugely music-saturated family like mine. There's nothing quite like being able to pull out an acoustic guitar around a campfire, and sing a few songs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Be outside. The air in the cubicles, cars, and buildings that make up your daily life doesn't smell anywhere near as good as it does just a few feet past the doorway. And there's no better way to break out of a daily routine than to take a short stroll. It opens your eyes to things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Have friends. And while you're at it, make them good ones. Not those fake, backstabbing, gossiping kind that a lot of people like to have. Surround yourself with people who inspire you to be better and enjoy yourself more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Take photos. Grab a camera and a few friends, and go off on some adventure. This is how I spent many a Summer growing up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Drive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. Listen to a different station.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7. Don't take politics too seriously. I mean it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8. Eat light and breezy. Eat a variety of things, don't settle for eating garbage. Eat like you're rich, or you're visiting a new part of the world, and taste part of all the local specialties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9. Forget the alarm clock. If you don't have to live by an alarm, don't.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10. Exercise. It makes you feel good on many different levels. For optimum results, get at least two other people to go with you at regular days and times. That way, you'll stick with it, and enjoy it more.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/christianity-is-love/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/christianity-is-love/</link><pubDate>Sun Jan 15 00:28:16 CST 2017</pubDate><title>Christianity is Love</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>Christianity is the assertion that love is the most powerful force in the universe.

(And by the way, if you don’t have those, I’m not sure you’re fully human.) But Christianity has always understood love as much more than emotions, instincts, or feelings. So let’s start by proposing a technical definition of ‘love’: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Love is the reconciliation of differing interests&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we step into this technical understanding, it becomes clear that love is essential at all kinds of scales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Certainly, love is what allows a family, a community, a society, or a civilization to function. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it is also foundational to simply being alive. What is multicellular life but the cooperation of vast numbers of smaller beings? What is an ecosystem but the interlocking relationships of creatures of all sizes and kinds? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Love is even what allows a mind to function. By reconciling its internal, conflicting interests, a mind can operate in the world. Failure to reconcile those interests is what we call insanity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s distinctive about Christianity is that it doesn’t simply suggest that love is good, or that we &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be loving—it suggests that love has &lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/2015/08/07/infinite-morality-jesus"&gt;unlimited reach&lt;/a&gt;. There is no limit to how broadly love should be applied. Love is infinite—“God &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; love”, as it states in the New Testament.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people have a tendency to read that statement as simply saying that “God is loving”, that God has love as one of his attributes. But I wonder if we should read it more literally. I’ve already argued that the substance of civilization and society and community is love. I’ve argued that the substance of our own &lt;em&gt;minds&lt;/em&gt; is love, as well. Why, then, can’t God’s substance be love?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, the concept of &lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/the-creative-process-of-god"&gt;the trinity&lt;/a&gt; is just such a claim. By defining God as a community of three persons, eternally locked together in a loving embrace (or, a &lt;em&gt;dance&lt;/em&gt;, as the Orthodox would have it), love becomes the very substance and essence of what God is. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It seems to go without saying that Christianity extends this all-encompassing philosophy of love to ethics. As Jesus says when asked about the greatest commandment of the Law: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength. And love your neighbor as yourself. On this hang all the Law and the Prophets.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I read this, Jesus is saying that these two commands sum up the whole thing. Everything else is an extrapolation of these two points. Paul makes this even more explicit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Do not murder, do not steal, do not commit adultery…and whatever other commandment there may be, are summed up in this: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself’. Love does no harm to its neighbor, therefore love is the fulfillment of the Law.” (Romans 13:8-10)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of the New Testament writers consistently held this idea: The entire collection of instructions in what we call the Old Testament were simply applications of &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; for a specific time and place. When that time and place were no longer relevant, those rules no longer applied, but love remained constant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the instructions we read in the New Testament were not intended as universal ethical principles, but were applications of love for a very particular context. This is apparent even in format: unlike the books of the Old Testament, the majority of the New Testament consists of &lt;em&gt;letters&lt;/em&gt; written to specific groups of people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, love is no more apparent than in the central image of the Christian story—the death and resurrection of Jesus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This image has been incredibly compelling throughout history, and yet, people have a tough time making sense of it. As a result, all kinds of analytical thought is poured into what are called “atonement theories”—ideas on how to explain this event in a logical, or economic, or legal way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the image itself, and what it means, are clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Resurrection is the triumph of life over death. And when we understand Jesus as the embodiment of love, then his resurrection is nothing less than a demonstration that love is the most powerful force in the universe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This point becomes clearer when we look at the world of the Gospels themselves. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jesus spent his ministry preaching love as the ultimate power. But the Roman Empire saw itself as the ultimate power, and it understood that power to come from wielding violence—as expressed most clearly in the practice of crucifixion. In a crucifixion, Rome could simultaneously destroy their enemies, and strike fear into the hearts of everyone around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So when Rome nails Jesus to the cross, we’re seeing a showdown between two claims about ultimate power. A person who claims that love is ultimate, is going up against an empire which claims that death and violence is ultimate. And both sides are bringing only their own favored weapons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, Rome killed Jesus, and assumed that they had won. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But soon, people were claiming otherwise—claiming, in fact, that Rome could not keep its victims dead. This was a blow to the heart of their power: if violence cannot guarantee that its victims stay dead, it cannot guarantee anything at all. Violence is left utterly powerless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Jesus was raised, then love has defeated violence, fear, and death—not to mention a world empire. Love is truly the most powerful force in the universe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the earliest moments, Christians talked about the resurrection in exactly this way. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is what Christianity is about. Whether it’s ethics, our understanding of God, our thoughts about the future, or the central image of the Christian story—it’s all love, from first to last. Every bit of it is an attempt to explain, demonstrate, or extrapolate on love. &lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/09/20/1348202524/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/09/20/1348202524/</link><pubDate>Thu Sep 20 23:42:04 CDT 2012</pubDate><title>1348202524</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>Romans 13 addresses how God uses the cycle of violence to limit itself.

This is played out in the Old Testament over and over (Babylon punishing Israel, other nations punishing Babylon), and is foretold or set up in the Genesis story of Noah, when God tells Noah that whoever sheds blood will have his blood shed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea is that there is an order of self-limiting violence, and an order of peace. Christians should choose to live in the order of peace, and neither revolt against nor participate in the order of violence. After all, those who participate in the order of violence die by the order of violence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/104954018205/permalink/10151424717413206/?comment_id=10151424730053206&amp;offset=0&amp;total_comments=2"&gt;https://www.facebook.com/groups/104954018205/permalink/10151424717413206/?comment_id=10151424730053206&amp;offset=0&amp;total_comments=2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2008/09/26/music/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2008/09/26/music/</link><pubDate>Fri Sep 26 15:33:00 CDT 2008</pubDate><title>Music</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>When I was growing up, the church I was part of was offended by Christian music.

According to the argument, worship only occurred in the church, without the use of instruments. Therefore, any music that DID use instruments was okay, as long as it was NOT intended to worship or praise God in any way. For instrumental music to offer thanks to God was for it to encroach on "God's music".&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thus, in a strange twist of logic, Christian music became the "devil's music". It was okay to listen to country, rock, or pop - just not Christian.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the same time, I was hanging out with another group of very conservative Christians. But their conservatism was in the other direction - they believed that all "secular music" was sinful, and it was only appropriate to listen to explicitly Christian music.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was in a very confusing situation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Driving up to someone's house with my radio tuned to the local Top 40 station would potentially earn me some looks and a reprimand. But to switch over to the local Christian station would offend others' conscience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Either way, I was straying outside the lines of what GOD considered appropriate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This odd dichotomy was characteristic of how I grew up, and it forced me to think very hard about a lot of things. One question I asked myself was "what music is from God?"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought very hard. Who was behind the melodies of different genres of music? Who was behind the driving beats? Who was behind the lyrical cleverness I admired so much?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it occurred to me that ALL of this was a creation of God. Just like Peter saw the unclean animals, and heard God tell him "eat!", I realized that there was no dichotomy. There was no music of the devil - all of it was from God.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every bit of a piece of music, from the rhythm to the chord progression, from the timbre of a singer's voice to the words of their lyrics, comes from God. The fact that notes can come together to make chords, the way a rhythm resonates with you, our entire ability to appreciate another person's musical creation - it's entirely a gift from God.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which is not to say that some music isn't offensive or disturbing. But nothing can be disturbing or ugly without a reference point - a God-given beauty hidden inside it. Even if I don't choose to listen to rap, r&amp;amp;b, or much country, I still have to acknowledge that the existence of any of those genres can only be traced to God.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the middle ages, there was a theory called "The Ape of God". The devil, the argument went, can only imitate what God has created. Therefore everything evil is simply a distorted imitation of something good. It was an insightful way to look at the world, and all the things attributed to Satan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it did not go far enough. There is nothing that a devil can create that God has not already made - no pleasure that can be created that God did not call into existence. Even if there is something horrendous and ugly, it is not even an &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;imitation&lt;/span&gt; of God's handiwork. An imitation of God's creation can never escape the fact that only God allows its existence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The devil himself can only exist because of God's graciousness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything that exists is from God. Look closely and see it.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/04/17/singularity-why-future-closer-you-think/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/04/17/singularity-why-future-closer-you-think/</link><pubDate>Tue Apr 17 10:35:34 CDT 2012</pubDate><title>The Singularity: Why the Future is Closer Than You Think</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>This past Saturday, Ryan Hogan, John Yates and I delivered a presentation and panel discussion on the future of accelerating change at Nashville Podcamp.

The session went well, and we had a lot of great questions and discussion from the audience. We mainly used our slides as a jumping-off point for discussion, but they should give you a bit of the flavor of that discussion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you can't view the presentation below, click &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/pub?id=1j5uStMFveZVvyWb03e0WAkYE8ePUfuarEid9GqO7IZU&amp;start=false&amp;loop=false&amp;delayms=3000"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to go directly to a fullscreen view.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://docs.google.com/presentation/embed?id=1j5uStMFveZVvyWb03e0WAkYE8ePUfuarEid9GqO7IZU&amp;start=false&amp;loop=false&amp;delayms=3000" frameborder="0" width="480" height="389" allowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We start by introducing the concept of Moore's Law, and how that results in a Singularity sometime in our future. Then we talk about how the effects of accelerating technology gradually and catastrophically break into other parts of society, as evidenced by upheavals in the entertainment industry, book publishing, and governments. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most significantly for individuals, our next five years are always harder to predict than the last five years were. This means that we personally are entering into a state of perpetual future shock. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can see this in society as "movements" are being replaced by flash-mobs, spontaneous events which have no future and no past. Occupy Wall Street is perhaps the epitome of our times - a movement that is really just an ongoing flash mob.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then we look at how humanity has always been integrated with our technology - from campfires to stone tools to cellphones - and how that integration is only increasing. We are all cyborgs now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2006/11/17/what-is-real-music/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2006/11/17/what-is-real-music/</link><pubDate>Fri Nov 17 18:11:00 CST 2006</pubDate><title>What is Real Music?</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>I wrote this February 19, 2004...not long after I "got off the boat" and landed in WV.

It's weird how time seems so compressed sometimes. Anyway, here it is. Enjoy.&lt;br /&gt;-micah&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is good music? I guess there are two ideas:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Whatever sells the most records. This has led to most of the "pop" musicians, including Britney, Christina, NSync, Backstreet Boys, etc. Generally speaking, this is all fluff, and no substance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Whatever pushes the artistic envelope. This has led to a lot of "underground" bands and musicians. Generally speaking, this stuff disregards what normal people "like" to hear, and tells them what they "need" to hear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don't really like either of these. The whole "pop" thing is rather sickening, like eating too much icing. But the whole "underground" thing is often just poor taste shrouded in artistic snobbery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both of these groups of people need to come down off their "high horses" and mingle with the people. That's where I believe the real music is at.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Real music, in my opinion, is folk music. I don't mean the "folk" style of music, I mean the "folk" approach to music. Folk music historically originated as common people wrote songs that dealt with subjects that they understood. Then they rewrote them and revised them, changed them for their moods and environments, until the songs came to belong to the community, rather than to any individual. People would sing these songs as they worked, when they felt deep feelings of love or loneliness, or when they were feeling playful and wanted to relax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I value folk music for that reason, because there is something much more "real" in it than there is anywhere else. But I also value the music that is similar to folk music in spirit, if not in style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The modern equivalent of folk music is everywhere, in every genre. It appears whenever a song is picked up by the people, sung and hummed while people are working, and worked into the background of people's lives. It appears whenever people of different generations and social classes can spontaneously burst into singing the same song. It appears whenever it becomes obvious that a song has transcended our particular situation and touched something a little deeper in our humanity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fifty years from now, I won't care whether artistic critics lauded my music or not. I won't care whether my music was a "pop" success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I want, fifty years from now, is to walk down the streets and pass an open window, and hear someone singing one of my songs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That will be real satisfaction for me.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2011/12/01/i-am-orthodox/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2011/12/01/i-am-orthodox/</link><pubDate>Thu Dec 01 13:58:00 CST 2011</pubDate><title>i am orthodox</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>I don't have much use for the term Orthodox.

I think it means "within the bounds of historic Christianity", but those bounds have been moving ever since Jesus forgot to specify which disciple got to call all the shots. When Martin Luther broke away from the Catholic church, they shifted radically. At that point, he would have been called unorthodox. Today, it's his intellectual heirs labeling people that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, in just about everything that I think, I'm straight-down-the-line orthodox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nothing I will tell you about the nature of God, or of Jesus, or the scriptures, or the spirit, or the &lt;em&gt;ecclesia&lt;/em&gt;, is outside the bounds of &lt;em&gt;historic christian orthodoxy&lt;/em&gt;. But that doesn't mean I won't offend all kinds of people. &lt;a href="https://www.robbell.com/lovewins/"&gt;Rob Bell&lt;/a&gt; is orthodox too, but he threw Twitter and the Christian world into uproar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year I went to this conference at which all kinds of people were invited to participate, from liberal to conservative. A lot of people got up and talked about how we have to re-conceive of God, and be willing to let go of our antiquated ideas about what kind of being God is. Some of them even went so far as to indicate a kind of atheism, where they retained the use of the word "God" for convenience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then they got to the part of the conference in which they discussed their own backgrounds. Each one argued strongly that in a changing world, their denomination was still needed, still relevant, and must remain distinct and unique.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then my friend got up. He explained how his own spiritual journey led him to leave his denomination of origin, and affiliate purely with God alone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was the most offensive speaker there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone was free to question everything up to and including God himself, and it was still orthodox. But question the idea that denominations should exist, that congregations are needed, that we need &lt;em&gt;institutions of spirituality&lt;/em&gt; - and all hell breaks loose. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That kind of cues me in on where a lot of theology is coming from. It also lets me know where the lines are drawn - and just how much ire I stand to raise. So that's why I'm telling you that I'm orthodox. And it's why I think it's important to think about our fundamentals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What, to you, is the thing you can't afford to change? What can you not afford to question?&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2004/04/20/tulsa-workshop-pictures-available-04192004/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2004/04/20/tulsa-workshop-pictures-available-04192004/</link><pubDate>Tue Apr 20 02:24:00 CDT 2004</pubDate><title>Tulsa Workshop pictures available - 04/19/2004</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>TULSA, OK - In late March, the Reddings traveled to Tulsa and performed in several area venues, including the massive Tulsa Expo Center.

On May 4th, around noon, he died peacefully, surrounded by friends and family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.humans.family/patrick-hogan"&gt;People express their grief in many ways&lt;/a&gt;—and I have grieved in many ways over these last few weeks. One way that I express it, though, is to try to put my thoughts in order, to try to capture what I am experiencing and processing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are some things I wrote during this process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think that all expressions of grief capture something that is true, and leave out something that is true—including this one. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read it in that spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Death is bad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone who tells you otherwise has either not experienced it personally and individually, or is trying to find a way of coming to terms with just how bad it is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is a tragedy—a loss of so many, &lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt; irreplaceable things. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who believe in an afterlife or a higher spiritual dimension might suggest that the person hasn’t really been lost at all. Why, therefore, should we cry? What has really been lost?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But something significant &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; been lost:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What really is the value of life, if not this? What is it we struggle for, fight for, and remember about someone, if not their relationships? What do we live to do?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We live to &lt;em&gt;be in relationship&lt;/em&gt;—with people, animals, our bodies, the physical world. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of us want long, healthy, productive and meaningful lives. We want to contribute to others in our community, our society, our family. We want to create new things, and fix old things. We want to share joy and jokes and stories with other people, who will then share joy and jokes and stories with us. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Relationships, in the deepest sense, are who we are. We are not atomic, isolated, Cartesian minds—we are a deeply intertwined network of relationships, stretching out to the ends of the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Death takes all of this away. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don’t want to mitigate this reality. I don’t want to hide from, or sugar-coat these facts. I want to know it and acknowledge it fully, for the all-embracing tragedy it is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In that way, I know that whatever hope I find, and whatever goodness I discover, is no mere coping mechanism for hiding from the truth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whatever else I say, I want to know that it isn’t a shallow platitude, but something that can ring out through the halls of an ICU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think there's something good that happens when we grieve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We focus our thoughts and memories, we take stock of a person's impact on the world, we realize they reached far beyond what we might assume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We think of all the things we wish we had done. We process all the missed opportunities. We celebrate them and mourn them and love them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is good, and I think that sometimes the goodness of it makes us think that death itself is desirable. Like maybe finitude is the value of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that's a mistake. This process of bringing good out of bad requires life. This is what life is—it's what life does. The goodness contained in grief isn't brought to us by death. It's created by life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grief is a taste of resurrection. Life bringing life out of even death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Death is a tragedy. That’s the reality of it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Death is a doorway to a better life”&lt;br/&gt;...or...&lt;br/&gt;“Life is valuable because it is finite”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are both ways of saying that death is not &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; a tragedy. But I would rather just face the tragedy head-on. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a sense, my whole project is to figure out how &lt;em&gt;hope&lt;/em&gt; can be real and meaningful, without ever backing away from the tragedy of our lived experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The resolution is to recognize that tragedy is real—but that tragedy can be ameliorated, and eventually, overcome. And what we learn through the tragedy can make the final outcome better than it would have been.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s redemption. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it requires our participation. We have to recognize tragedy for the horror it is, grieve it, and learn from it. Only then can we participate with life in overcoming that tragedy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this is complicated. Thinking about death, the loss of someone is a tragedy, and it’s a tragedy that compounds. Even if they are resurrected, we will have lost immeasurable opportunities in between.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That might indicate that death can be overcome, but never ceases to be a tragedy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unless there's something else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps if we learn from their loss, then their resurrection can do more than simply undo the loss. Perhaps it can create new, better possibilities for that relationship. Perhaps we can all make better choices on the other side, than we ever would have otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If that’s a possibility, it’s one that requires us to be involved and engaged in learning from and seeking to overcome these tragedies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that's why I never want to draw back from any of it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whatever the loss, I want to be there, in the flesh, experiencing that very real tragedy with all of my being.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2004/09/11/taylor-books-performance-in-charleston-wv-friday-91004/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2004/09/11/taylor-books-performance-in-charleston-wv-friday-91004/</link><pubDate>Sat Sep 11 02:29:00 CDT 2004</pubDate><title>Taylor Books performance in Charleston, WV - Friday 9/10/04</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>9/10/04 - The Redding Brothers will be performing in Charleston at Taylor Books on Friday, September 10th, 7:30-9:30pm.

I definitely suggest putting your name on the invitation &lt;a href="http://voice.google.com/"&gt;list&lt;/a&gt;. But how does this relate to living lightly?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google Voice is a tool for centralizing phone numbers and voicemail. I've already centralized my phone in one way: by using a cellphone, and not having a home phone, life is streamlined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But my voicemail and contact list has always been lacking. After all, I can only put so many contacts in my phone, and the list is not very user-friendly. I tend to forget about most voicemails, because they are inconvenient to check. Google Voice solves a lot of that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google Voice gives one phone number which can be routed to any phone. You can switch between phones at will, without changing your number, or needing to inform anyone of these changes. The one phone number always routes to you, wherever you direct it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Better, Google Voice allows you to browse, organize, and listen to voicemails as if they were emails.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, yesterday, I switched my cellphone voicemail over to Google Voice, following &lt;a href="http://www.marketing.fm/2009/05/14/use-google-voice-without-changing-your-number/"&gt;these instructions&lt;/a&gt;. Now, if you call my number and get no answer, you will be routed to Google Voice to leave a message. I also set up to make phone calls from my computer, without a phone, using &lt;a href="http://www.jrin.net/2009_07_26/use-gizmo5-for-free-calls-with-google-voice"&gt;this guide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which means I will probably be better at answering your messages. And I don't have to worry as much about losing my phone. And I can switch service providers when I want. And I can check my voicemail online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which means I can go un-tethered more often.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2006/12/16/rock-roll-can-save-the-world/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2006/12/16/rock-roll-can-save-the-world/</link><pubDate>Sat Dec 16 08:26:00 CST 2006</pubDate><title>Rock &amp; Roll Can Save The World</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>In a World where Bland Music is the Order of the Day…One band will take a stand against it all…And Pay…The Ultimate Price.…$12.99…Welcome to…Rock &amp;amp; Roll Can Save The World…-micah...</description><content:encoded>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;In a World where Bland Music is the Order of the Day…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One band will take a stand against it all…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And Pay…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Ultimate Price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$12.99&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Welcome to&lt;br /&gt;…&lt;a href="http://thereddingbrothers.blogspot.com/"&gt;Rock &amp;amp; Roll Can Save The World&lt;/a&gt;…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-micah&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2006/12/07/my-favorite-christmas-carol/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2006/12/07/my-favorite-christmas-carol/</link><pubDate>Thu Dec 07 23:37:00 CST 2006</pubDate><title>My Favorite Christmas Carol</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>If you were to decide on your favorite Christmas carol, what would it be?Maybe the traditional "White Christmas"?

I'm dreaming of a...&lt;br /&gt;Or the ridiculous "Grandma got run over by a reindeer"?&lt;br /&gt;Or the fun and frivolity-filled "Jingle Bells"?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, my favorite has got to be "Carol of the Bells". Why? Because it's the only Christmas song I can imagine being sung whole-heartedly by Scrooge himself. Think about the words:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"Hark how the bells, sweet silver bells, all seem to say throw cares away..."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here we have a nice lyrical section about the sweet sound of bells. Except the tune is anything but sweet! It's dark and foreboding, ominous at least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"One seems to hear words of good cheer, from everywhere, filling the air..."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sounds nice and pleasant, right? Well the tune is more in line with a guy on the verge of a mental meltdown. He knows the voices aren't real; that's why he only SEEMS to hear words of good chear, and they come at him from every corner of the room!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"Oh how they pound! Raising the sound! O'er hill and dale, telling their tale!"&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the music beats to a crescendo, it conveys the very strong image of a guy being driven crazy by the incessant ringing of bells. He becomes progressively more frantic. And is driven inevitably to the conclusion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"Gaily they ring! While people sing! Songs of good cheer, Christmas...Is...Here!!!"&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In no other Christmas song do I get the strong picture of some Scrooge-like madman running around yelling about "the bells! the bells!" while holding his hands over his ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which is why I think this Christmas-time celebration of insanity is so nice. And why it's just so fitting that we should do our own version. So TODAY, we are putting "Carol of The Bells" from our SNOW EP online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://myspace.com/reddingbrothers"&gt;Listen on Myspace&lt;/a&gt;, or&lt;br /&gt;Purchase from &lt;a href="http://www.reddingbrothers.com/"&gt;ReddingBrothers.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/black-panther-transhumanist-future/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/black-panther-transhumanist-future/</link><pubDate>Mon Feb 19 08:12:09 CST 2018</pubDate><title>Black Panther is the Transhumanist Future We Need</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>I’ve just returned from seeing [Black Panther](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjDjIWPwcPU), and not only is it a great superhero movie, it is one of the most tech-positive movies I’ve seen in a long ...</description><content:encoded>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I’ve just returned from seeing &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjDjIWPwcPU"&gt;Black Panther&lt;/a&gt;, and not only is it a great superhero movie, it is one of the most tech-positive movies I’ve seen in a long time. Its story-telling offers to reorient the entire superhero genre around deep questions of technology and human progress. And its heroes are not simply fighting bad guys in defense of an established order—they are actively involved in advancing the future of the human race.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;gt; Spoilers ahead &amp;lt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the movie, Black Panther is the king of a small African nation named &lt;em&gt;Wakanda&lt;/em&gt;, which long ago isolated itself from the rest of the world. Early in its history, a meteorite struck their country, leaving behind a mountain of a rare metals with extraordinary properties. Realizing what they had to lose if outsiders heard of this, they performed a vanishing act, disappeared from the face of the earth, and began an incredible process of technological development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the basis of everything that happens. The heroes aren’t mutants, or born with supernatural powers. Instead, as they tell a newcomer, “There’s no magic here—just technology”. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the Wakandans, that technology includes highly advanced medical knowledge, the tools to make people stronger and less susceptible to injury, and the ability to stabilize and revive people normally thought of as dead. It allows them to create bulletproof clothing, 3-dimensional “holograms” made out of material particles, and even—as one bystander puts it—“a Bugatti spaceship”. It has made their society a veritable garden city, with vast, highly-developed urban areas bursting with organic life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of this progress is fueled by deeply-held values, and a culture of strong internal critique.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wakanda is offered as a profound vision of hope. Every time it impinges on the outside world, it leaves tantalizing hints to a greater reality, the possibility of dramatic transformative change. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the movie, it has the most dramatic impact on children, many of whom may have been led to believe that certain possibilities were unreachable or off-limits. It holds up both an ideal to strive for, and an insistence that these efforts are not futile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is what a good superhero story does. Think of Superman being called “The Man of Tomorrow”—he was explicitly a harbinger from humanity’s future, sent to Earth to inspire and exemplify what we may become.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s remarkable about &lt;em&gt;Black Panther&lt;/em&gt; is that this doesn’t stop with the hero. In fact, he is surrounded by heroes of all kinds, from computer scientists to charity workers. This movie isn’t a “super-team” movie, where the main character joins forces with characters from other storylines—this is a movie that shows the hero as part of a working, breathing, family of heroism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And this extends all the way to Wakanda itself. Where Superman can evoke nostalgia for the lost civilization of Krypton, &lt;em&gt;Black Panther&lt;/em&gt; invites us to imagine a technologically advanced society, actively engaged in the unfolding business of advancing the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is what a good utopian vision does. It does not insist, in a Pollyanna-like fashion, that everything is fine the way it is. Nor does it suggest that a perfect society can be found by trying to emulate the society of an earlier time. Nor does it offer a static blueprint around which a society can be constructed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, it offers a snapshot of a society built around dramatic new possibilities—and by painting that image in high resolution, it convinces us that those possibilities are actually not that far away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because it does this, Wakanda is the kind of utopian vision that has the power to inspire real-world progress. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wakanda is &lt;em&gt;The New Atlantis&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/francis-bacon-christian-transhumanist"&gt;I’ve touched on recently&lt;/a&gt;, Francis Bacon’s utopian vision of &lt;a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Atlantis-Great-Instauration-Crofts-Classics-ebook/dp/B01DQ3GZ9M/ref=as_li_ss_tl?linkId=ce35711734b8f11f13027d757acf19b8&amp;me=&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=micahredding-20&amp;_encoding=UTF8"&gt;The New Atlantis&lt;/a&gt;, published in 1627, helped inspire Britain to launch a period of unprecedented technological development. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In every respect, Wakanda is the kind of society Francis Bacon was dreaming of when he penned that vision. It is founded on strong values, a culture of humility and internal critique, and a recognition of the power of knowledge. And in the story, this generates vast technological progress, leading to great power. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And with great power comes great questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Wakanda and Bacon’s New Atlantis are isolated societies, which have largely avoided any interaction with the outside world. As the stories dawn, these societies are wrestling with deep questions about how this situation will continue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Will they continue to be isolationists, allowing the world around them to go on suffering? Will they use their power to take over everything else, and run the world their own way? Or will they share their knowledge, lifting up others along with them?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are, of course, the choices we always face when wielding great power. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bacon’s account of the New Atlantis was never completed, and so left this question hanging. But it was a bold enough vision to inspire Britain to aim at becoming a New Atlantis themselves—embarking on several centuries of incredible technological progress. This gave them incredible power, and brought them face-to-face with this precise dilemma. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How would they use their power? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How would they complete the story of the New Atlantis?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As it happened, Britain used its power to take control, creating an empire on which the sun never set. Britain took the power they had gained through self-governance, and used it to destroy the self-governance of large parts of the world. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This had vast consequences, which still reverberate through our world today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Black Panther&lt;/em&gt;, the Wakandans are grappling with and reflecting on those consequences. All around them, countries had been colonized and pillaged by foreign powers with greater technology. Millions had been killed, enslaved, and oppressed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Was it time for Wakanda to turn the tables, and use their greater technology to reenact what others had done? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Should Wakanda become the new British Empire?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or should they write a new ending? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Should they share their knowledge, and lift up the world along with them?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the question at the heart of &lt;em&gt;Black Panther&lt;/em&gt;. Wakanda is a &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; New Atlantis, wrestling with the failures of the old one. Wakanda knows that no utopia is complete until it has found a vision for how it will use its power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For much of the last century, our society has grappled with the legacy of its scientific and technological revolutions. The mixed results of our uses of power have led many to question whether there might be something wrong with technology itself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is every technological society doomed to repeat the violent choices of the past? Will every bold and inspiring vision ultimately spawn fresh new versions of hell?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Black Panther&lt;/em&gt; boldly takes on these questions, grappling with all the complexity they entail. It gives us a fresh new vision of technological utopia. And it holds out hope that a world inspired by a Wakandan New Atlantis might not simply repeat the mistakes of the past, but might seize the possibilities of a much, &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; greater future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.christiantranshumanism.org"&gt;Learn more about Christian Transhumanism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2008/10/17/thinking-about-genesis/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2008/10/17/thinking-about-genesis/</link><pubDate>Fri Oct 17 16:11:00 CDT 2008</pubDate><title>Thinking about Genesis</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>I have been doing some reading about Genesis, the beginnings of humanity, and the evolutionary account of human origins.

It strikes me that a bit of clarity in thinking is in order. One may take several stances on the Genesis account:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The account is of divine origin, and describes a beginning totally distinct from that proposed by modern science. This we can call the &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;literalist&lt;/span&gt; stance. This view holds to a very literal understanding of the events described in Genesis 1-3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The account is of divine origin, and concerns itself only with very recent history, in harmony with the account of modern science. This we can call the &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;localist&lt;/span&gt; stance. This view might hold that Adam was the first Jewish person, or the first person chosen by God (like Noah or Abraham) to carry out God's wishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The account is of divine origin, and is a complex metaphor about all of history, in harmony with modern science. This we can call the &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;allegorical&lt;/span&gt; stance. This view might hold that the 6 days of creation were six ages, and that Adam represents a primordial tribe, or a succession of different individuals over hundreds of thousands or millions of years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The account is not of divine origin, but was intended to understood as literally true, just like in view #1. It just happens to be wrong, and modern science is right. This we might call the &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;secular literalist&lt;/span&gt; stance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The account is not of divine origin, but concerns itself with the recent past, which the Jewish people would have had records of. This we might call the &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;secular localist&lt;/span&gt; stance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The account is not of divine origin, but is a complex metaphor about all of history, in harmony with modern science. This we can call the &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;secular allegorical&lt;/span&gt; stance. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;What is confusing to me is the number of people who seem to hold view #6. As in, they don't believe the account is divinely inspired, but they believe it deals with realities of science that we're only just now discovering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as #3, the idea of day-ages seems fairly straight-forward, with precedent in ancient Jewish interpretations. But how does this view deal with Adam? Many of the &lt;a href="http://www.geocities.com/ulrich_utiger/gen4.html"&gt;ideas I've run across&lt;/a&gt; have a complex understandings of just who Adam is. The idea that God intended to reveal the truth about human origins, but delivered this in a complex allegory in which multiple persons over hundreds of thousands of years are summed up as one individual seems a little preposterous. To be specific, some of the interpretations I've read don't seem like anything one could ever deduce from the text.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are other views possible. One view which I believe will gain a lot of ground in the near future is that the story is not chronological at all, but symbolic of processes and truths. So that the days of creation aren't intended to indicate that grass was created before fish, but that there is a pattern to the order of the universe. The days of creation follow a pattern of separation and then filling: Light is separated from dark on day 1, then sun and moon and stars fill this division on day 4; Clouds and separated from sea on day 2, then birds and fish fill these respective areas on day 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These views are the broad picture - the details can vary greatly.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/the-resurrection-is-technological/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/the-resurrection-is-technological/</link><pubDate>Thu Sep 28 12:06:03 CDT 2017</pubDate><title>The Resurrection is Technological</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>In 1 Corinthians 15, Paul lays out an argument that many believe is at the heart of the Christian faith—an argument for the ultimate resurrection of all people, and the eradication of death itself.

P...</description><content:encoded>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;In 1 Corinthians 15, Paul lays out an argument that many believe is at the heart of the Christian faith—an argument for the ultimate resurrection of all people, and the eradication of death itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paul’s explanation of this belief is often overlooked, but it is an explanation that ties into the deepest structures and suppositions of the biblical story: the biblical understanding of what it means to be human.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;For since death came through a man, the resurrection of the dead comes also through a man… (1 Corinthians 15:21)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the biblical account, humans were created to rule over all creation. That rule necessarily meant being free from the constraints of death, and so according to Genesis, humans were created with the tree of life planted at their front doorstep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Physical immortality was within humanity’s reach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that didn’t last long. As the story has it, humans made a bad choice, and were subsequently barred from the tree of life. Instead of the possibility of physical immortality, human existence reverted to the natural order of things (&lt;a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+3%3A19&amp;version=NIV"&gt;“dust you are, and to dust you shall return”&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Somehow, the very possibility of physical immortality had hinged on human choices, and because those choices were bad, the possibility of escaping the normal cycle of life and death had vanished. Humans were now destined to die. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Death came through man.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that’s not the end of the story. In fact, the story repeatedly insists that humanity will ultimately be triumphant, rising up from this defeat to take their intended place in the natural order of things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The entire biblical story can be seen as humanity’s long path back to ruling over all creation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We might be uncomfortable with this idea of humans reigning over creation. After all, isn’t this the attitude that has led to environmental destruction and catastrophe? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the biblical story, this would be a misunderstanding. Humanity is intended to rule over the world as an imitation of the way God rules over the world—creating and cultivating life, taking joy in its appearance, calling forth its own creative potential. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earth—&lt;a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans+8%3A18-21&amp;version=NIV"&gt;indeed, the cosmos itself&lt;/a&gt;—is intended to flourish through humanity’s reign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus, the very first thing that happens to humans in the Bible, is that they are placed in the Garden of Eden, and instructed to “&lt;a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=genesis+2%3A15"&gt;tend it and keep it&lt;/a&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These words directly imply the use of tools. For the Bible, humanity’s task and true purpose starts with learning to use tools for agriculture. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn’t limited to the Garden of Eden. Genesis 1 commissions humanity to go into all the Earth, exploring, gardening and bringing peace and order to a chaotic world. They are to get their start gardening in Eden, and then extend those skills to all creation, tending to and cultivating birds, fish, animals, Earth itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is science and technology in their most embryonic forms. Humanity is not only commissioned to cultivate life, they are &lt;em&gt;equipped&lt;/em&gt; to cultivate life. Unlike other creatures, humans are able to contemplate and understand natural processes, and then create new things—new technologies—to manage and use those processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is part of what it means for humans to be made in the image of the creator. Our incredible ability to contemplate non-existent possibilities, and bring new things into existence, is what has given us unprecedented power on the Earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Psalm 8 reflects on this fact:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I consider your heavens,&lt;br/&gt;    the work of your fingers,&lt;br/&gt;the moon and the stars,&lt;br/&gt;    which you have set in place,&lt;br/&gt;what is mankind that you are mindful of them,&lt;br/&gt;    human beings that you care for them?&lt;br/&gt;You have made them a little lower than the angels&lt;br/&gt;    and crowned them with glory and honor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You made them rulers over the works of your hands;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    **you put everything under their feet**:&lt;br/&gt;all flocks and herds,&lt;br/&gt;    and the animals of the wild,&lt;br/&gt;the birds in the sky,&lt;br/&gt;    and the fish in the sea,&lt;br/&gt;    all that swim the paths of the seas. (Psalm 8:3-8) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The psalmist evokes Genesis 1, and reflects poetically on the mystery of the human condition. The cosmos is wondrous, complex, and beautiful—and humankind is small, weak, and frail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And yet, somehow, humanity has been given this ability to rule over all things. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This passage comes up again and again in the New Testament, as the first Christians explain the meaning and significance of Christ. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the New Testament sees it, humanity had been given dominion over all things, but through their bad choices, had compromised that dominion, and had brought death upon themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, God had promised that humanity would rule over all things, and God wasn’t going to change his mind, or turn things over to someone else. Instead, God would become human, embodying and restoring his intentions for humanity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hebrews 2 explains that this is the reason Christ had to come as a human. Christ would be the “true human”, the &lt;a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+8%3A29&amp;version=NIV"&gt;first-fruits&lt;/a&gt; of a renewed humanity, living out its dominion as God intended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is not to angels that he has subjected the world to come, about which we are speaking. But there is a place where someone has testified: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What is mankind that you are mindful of them,&lt;br/&gt;    a son of man that you care for him?&lt;br/&gt;You made them a little lower than the angels;&lt;br/&gt;    you crowned them with glory and honor&lt;br/&gt;    and &lt;em&gt;put everything under their feet&lt;/em&gt;.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In putting everything under them, God left &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt; that is not subject to them. Yet at present we do not see everything subject to them.&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But we do see Jesus…&lt;/strong&gt; (Hebrews 2:5-9) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Hebrews puts it, quoting Psalm 8, there was nothing that had not been made subject to humanity. Yet, because of human error, that rule had never been clearly seen—until Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Jesus, the one person who had triumphed over death, the rule that God had given to humanity was finally displayed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That triumph was never intended to be limited to one person. Christ’s triumph was intended to usher in a restoration of humanity’s intended rule, “bringing many sons and daughters to glory” (Hebrews 2:10). That process started with the invitation to imitate Christ, and thus to participate in his reign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;…if we endure, we will also reign with him. (2 Timothy 2:12)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the New Testament, the reign of Christ is simply the reign that God had always intended for humanity. It’s a reign we are called to participate in at all levels, even up to and including the apocalypse itself (1 Corinthians 6:3; Revelation 2:26-27; Revelation 20:4).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is how Paul understands the resurrection. The resurrection is not simply people being returned to life. It is humanity coming fully into its reign over all things. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Death is simply the last barrier to that reign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;For since death came through a man, the resurrection of the dead comes also through a man. For as in Adam all die, so in Christ all will be made alive. (1 Corinthians 15:21-22)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since humanity had ruined the possibility of physical immortality, it was necessary that humanity restore the possibility of physical immortality. And just as early humans had ushered in an era in which humanity was ruled by death, Christ would usher in an era in which humanity ruled &lt;em&gt;over&lt;/em&gt; death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;But each in turn: Christ, the firstfruits; then, when he comes, those who belong to him. (1 Corinthians 15:23)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Christ’s triumph over death would roll outwards, in a three-stage process. First, Christ himself was raised. Then, Christ’s followers would be raised. Finally, death itself would be completely destroyed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then the end will come, when he hands over the kingdom to God the Father after he has destroyed all dominion, authority and power. For he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet. The last enemy to be destroyed is death. (1 Corinthians 15:24-26)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The unfolding of Christ’s reign—the reign of humanity as God intended—would extend until everything had been brought into it. The very last thing that would be brought under humanity’s dominion would be death itself, bringing the story to completion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;For he “has put everything under his feet.” (1 Corinthians 15:27)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This quote of Psalm 8 sums it all up, connecting everything back to God’s original purposes for humanity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;God had intended for humans to have dominion over all creation. Through the earliest humans, that dominion had been compromised. Through Christ, that dominion was being restored. The ultimate extent of that restored dominion would be the complete and utter defeat of death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notice that, for Paul, this isn’t just a matter of God waving his hands and making it so? Instead, it’s an unfolding process, a seeming battle with the forces of destruction in the universe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;God intends to renew humanity’s dominion &lt;em&gt;through&lt;/em&gt; humanity’s dominion. The reign of Christ—the reign of true humanity, that we are called to participate in—is what ultimately defeats death, and ushers in the resurrection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The resurrection is the ultimate expression of humanity’s original commission to create and cultivate life. It is the same commission that humanity was given in the Garden, the commission they were told to bring into all the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is the commission we live out when we feed the hungry and heal the sick, the commission behind hospitals, and medical missions, and the pursuit of scientific cures. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is the commission which gave us art, science, and technology. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it is the commission which Paul says humanity—in Christ—will be fulfilling in the resurrection of the dead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Paul and the earliest Christians, there was no firm division between the advancement of good and the resurrection. They were both part of the unfolding reign of Christ, the restoration of humanity’s life-giving purpose, and would be expressed in everything from &lt;a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+2%3A10"&gt;good deeds&lt;/a&gt; and acts of compassion, to the ultimate &lt;a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans+8%3A18-21&amp;version=NIV"&gt;renewal of the entire cosmos&lt;/a&gt;, and the eradication of death itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that means that nothing good that we do, no good part of human life—whether art, science, imagination, or technology—is left out of that process.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2005/05/10/shows-this-weekend/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2005/05/10/shows-this-weekend/</link><pubDate>Tue May 10 21:33:00 CDT 2005</pubDate><title>Shows this weekend...</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>Okay, two shows this weekend...Colony TheaterHillsboro, OHFriday, May 13th7:00pmWith: Latest Heartbreak, Noah Smith group, Zack AndersonLocal Talent Showcase @ RendezvousTeays Valley, WVSaturday, May ...</description><content:encoded>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Okay, two shows this weekend...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Colony Theater&lt;br /&gt;Hillsboro, OH&lt;br /&gt;Friday, May 13th&lt;br /&gt;7:00pm&lt;br /&gt;With: Latest Heartbreak, Noah Smith group, Zack Anderson&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Local Talent Showcase @ Rendezvous&lt;br /&gt;Teays Valley, WV&lt;br /&gt;Saturday, May 14th &lt;br /&gt;7:00pm-9:30pm&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-micah&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2005/06/19/whats-with-the-scotch-tape/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2005/06/19/whats-with-the-scotch-tape/</link><pubDate>Sun Jun 19 13:49:00 CDT 2005</pubDate><title>...What's with the Scotch Tape???</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>Last night we played at the Attic Club in Dayton, OH, and there really weren't very many people there at all.

We also got to discuss the latest topics and issues, like who were those girls that were running around putting scotch tape on everyone's shoulders. And we got to play with some cool bands, including &lt;a href="http://www.inthered.us" target="_blank"&gt;In The Red&lt;/a&gt;, who are another 3 peice band that had an incredible sound (thanks for the CD guys!).

Read the previous entries &lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/series/christianity-anthropology"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the first century the entire world was under the power of the Roman Empire, the full embodiment of the &lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/03/19/works-devil"&gt;domination system&lt;/a&gt;, the violent outworking of the fear of death. Israel, and its capitol Jerusalem, were a small glitch in this landscape of darkness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But by this point, Rome was not only ruling over Israel, but hand-selecting the leaders of Jerusalem, drawing it deep into the machinations of the Empire. That influence permeated Jerusalem, to the point that the Jewish religious and political leaders had become deeply impressed with Rome’s power, enthralled by the civilization it offered, longing to participate in its strength. They positioned themselves in alliance with it, becoming part of the same matrix of power, violence, and lust that had controlled humanity since the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The city that was supposed to offer the world an alternative, had given in to the vast power of Rome. The city whose prophets had called it the “light of the world” had gone dark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many Jews saw this as deeply wrong. And so, on the outskirts of Jewish society, revolutionaries began to rise up, plotting to take back Jerusalem, planning to turn the nation back to its true identity. They believed that if they were successful, if they could restore Jerusalem to its true nature, then God would come to their side, and they would cast off the power of Rome. And then…and then, they would found a new empire, and rule the world from sea to shining sea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They were the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zealotry"&gt;zealots&lt;/a&gt;, the wielders of the knife.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And when Jesus appeared, he was understood to be an insurgent just like them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Jesus saw something that no one else saw. Jerusalem had sunk into the worship of violence that controlled the entire world. And the insurgents were no better. They too lusted for the power that Rome exercised, they too wished to establish an empire built on violence, slavery, and scapegoating. They thought they were fighting for freedom, but they were still slaves to the system of domination. If they were successful, the new empire they founded would be just as evil as the empires before. And this time, there would be no one left to oppose it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At night, Jesus carefully explained this to his followers. During the day, he stirred up the crowds with stories that provoked them to question the messages they were being fed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He and his followers were walking a razor-thin line. As Jesus saw it, on either side lay the end of the Jewish nation, and with it, the end of humanity’s hope. And right in the middle, on his vanishingly narrow path, was the one possibility for unraveling the whole system of violence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Jerusalem was supposed to be the city to challenge the world, then Jerusalem would have to be rebuilt from the ground up. And that is exactly what Jesus set out to do. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this new Jerusalem wouldn't be the same as the old one, seized by a violent takeover. This Jerusalem would be formed by the poor and the outcasts, the insurgents and the social pariahs, a city without walls or boundaries, a city capable of surviving the destruction of everything they knew.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This city would have no temple, no political structure, no hierarchy or domination, no point where anyone could exercise control. It would exist free from geography, free from buildings and armies, outside the grip of any conventional power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a city, they would have ways of dealing with disagreements and disputes. As a city, they would have ways of resisting any foreign occupation. But the ways of doing these things were unusual, creative, controversial. If sued, they would strip naked in court. If forced into carrying a soldier's luggage, they would refuse to turn it loose. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of being victims, the powerless would seize control in the most clever ways possible, mocking the entire system, exposing their oppressors, opening the door for both parties to escape the cycle of violence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Don't be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No matter what, they would not be drawn into the cycle of violence. Facing inhuman aggressors, they would become still more &lt;em&gt;human&lt;/em&gt;. They would refuse to let themselves be transformed into either aggressor or victim. This was the beginning of a new civilization, not based on violence, scapegoating, or victimizing, but on compassion, identity, and blatant honesty. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jesus was leading a revolution, but a revolution unlike any the world had ever seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;This “new Jerusalem” was on a collision course with the old Jerusalem. Although there was a lot of confusion as to Jesus’ exact intentions, it was clear that he was challenging the legitimacy of the institutions of Israel. If he wasn’t careful, he could upset the delicate alliance the leaders had in place, and bring Rome down on their heads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This meant that the political leaders of Jerusalem had no choice but to begin thinking about how to quietly rid themselves of this problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But quiet wasn't Jesus' style. As Passover was approaching, and Jerusalem was filling up with Jews from all over the world, Jesus went into the temple and shut it down. He turned over tables, released animals, and ran off the bankers that were doing business there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You have made this place a den of thieves!“ he shouted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He wasn’t just condemning the temple - he was condemning all of Jerusalem. He was reenacting the deeds of the prophets from centuries before, prophets who had testified against violence and oppression and exclusion. He was reminding Israel of their history and identity. They were supposed to be a light, but they had gone dark. They were supposed to offer an alternative, but they had given up their calling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He didn’t have to wait long for their response. Before morning, he had been seized by a mob, and was being rushed toward execution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The crucifixion was remarkable for several reasons. It was apparent that there was no good reason for Jesus' death, and no consistent charge brought against him. This was not a criminal case; this was an idealogical difference that could only be resolved through a show of force. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The system had one vision for humanity, a vision played out to the full extent in the Roman Empire, and one which the rulers of Jerusalem had completely bought into. Jesus had another vision, lived out in the communities he had generated, in his creativity and blatant truth-telling, in his steadfast determination to live from his own identity rather than one foisted on him. His was a humanity not built on violence, which did not scapegoat or victimize. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The system of violence had to remove this challenge to its legitimacy. And the crucifixion was how they would do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In exercising the power of death, the system could always guarantee two things: they would silence their victim, and they would destroy their victim's identity. The way it played out was always the same, as illustrated vividly by the thief crucified next to Jesus. Having been stripped of his dignity and humanity by the Roman forces, the thief doesn't lose faith in the system which put him there. Instead, he turns and begins channeling his rage and hurt onto Jesus, mocking him, looking for the one person he can still dominate. In his last moments, the thief has become fully possessed by the system which is destroying him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In totally consuming a person's being, the system proves its own legitimacy. If even its victims operate by its rules, then there is no one who is free. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cross was the battleground between these two systems; one which had held absolute dominion over humanity from the very beginning, and one which claimed humanity was something more, something only glimpsed and expressed fully by wild-eyed prophets, in ancient myths, and in one provocative Jewish insurgent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And so the system of domination pulled its last trick, and watched as it completely and utterly failed. On the cross, Jesus refused to hide, refused to become something less than he was, refused to give in to the fear and hatred and desire for revenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Forgive them. They don't even see what they're doing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With that, everyone around was forced to watch a clearly innocent man die without once bowing to the forces killing him. The system was exposed for the ugly, bitter, weakness that it was. The system was revealed to be powerless in the face of Jesus' identity. They had swords and spears and armies - and every one of those things looked helpless compared to Jesus hanging there, still determined to love his enemies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pain of that awareness was too much. The soldier involved in Jesus' death couldn't contain himself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This man was the son of God!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This had to be the most blasphemous statement a Roman soldier could utter. His eyes had been opened, and he couldn't help but curse the very basis of his own existence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And with that, the system lost. Not only had they failed to destroy this human being, they had shown that even if they could silence him, their own people would cry out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A peasant went up against an Empire. And the peasant won.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2006/12/31/were-the-founding-fathers-atheists/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2006/12/31/were-the-founding-fathers-atheists/</link><pubDate>Sun Dec 31 16:02:00 CST 2006</pubDate><title>Were the Founding Fathers atheists?</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>Pedro posted an article claiming that the founding fathers were not Christian, that they were deists, and that they WOULD have been atheists if they had had modern science.

Here was my response:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The founding fathers were NOT Christian. Big deal. Christians shouldn’t care. The governing authorities in Jesus’ time sure did not care about him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The founding fathers were deists, but would NOT have been atheists, because the question of where original variety (information) in the universe came from is not answered. With no original variety, gravity could not have caused the collapse of mass into stars and solar systems, etc. So where did this original information/variety come from? Their answer would have been “deism”.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most theists (including the ones in this string of comments) are not rational. But Jesus did not teach anything like most theists. He never would have encouraged war, violence, or banning scientific research. JESUS would never start a war. By contrast, the statement that atheists and deists did not start wars is obviously untrue. The founding fathers were DEISTS, and who do you think started the revolutionary war?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, Subjective “miracles” are not proof of anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not 100% certain of anything, but I don’t live by certainties, I live by reasonable probabilities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a theist. I am Christian.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Christianity is a form of panENtheism, which is a form of pantheism. Pantheism is not anti-theism. Pantheism holds that God = Reality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PanENtheism additionally holds that the visible universe is not the entirety of Reality. God = Reality, but Reality is bigger than 20 billion light years of space. This is scientific fact; the MHI of quantum physics states this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Christianity furthermore states that REALITY is personal. This is the sticking point; this is the hard one to accept.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-micah redding&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2011/09/16/reading-list/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2011/09/16/reading-list/</link><pubDate>Fri Sep 16 00:28:58 CDT 2011</pubDate><title>Reading List</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>Here are the books that I consider foundational for me.

I am against racism, prejudice, and discrimination of many different kinds. I believe in helping people, in doing good for the poor, in not fighting, etc. I am against killing people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I happen to be vegetarian, though not for philosophical reasons. I'm in a band, and that makes me suspect right off. I believe that the future is bright, I believe in human progress, and I am an optimist. I don't believe that the world is ending anytime soon (although that's a different story).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But one point that I really differ with liberals on, is the role of government.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Liberals tend to view the government as the great savior of humanity. Human progress is seen as occurring through the intervention of government, and the UN and other major governmental entities are seem as the culmination of the movement towards the good. More unity, activity, and regulation by government are seen as the means by which society becomes more civilized. Some liberals hope for the UN to evolve into some kind of one-world government.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I disagree with this viewpoint. But this does not make me a conservative. A conservative wants a strong central government so that the military can be strong, and people can be punished for things like drug use, and not following the fire code.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By contrast, I see the government as the source of society's ills. Do major corporations deceive and swindle the general public? The government is the source of the issue in the first place - governments create corporations from thin air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why is government bad? Because government is purely and simply one thing: force.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Government has no ability to reason, to persuade, to compromise. It can only threaten, beat, or kill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don't pay your taxes, it will lock you up, at gunpoint if necessary. If you don't believe in supporting some of the things it deems important, it will punish and eventually kill you. If you are on the wrong side of whatever ethnic division is currently popular, you will suffer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it tries to help you, it will do so by stealing from someone else. And it will only do so because it wants to look good, and secure its own future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And in helping you, it will force you to become dependent on it. It will attach rules and regulations to everything it does for you, until you are its slave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is horribly inefficient. If it gives you a dollar for food, it had to take ten dollars from someone else just to do so. If it tries to provide a service like mail, food, or driving privileges, it will do so in the most people-unfriendly manner possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not care about you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By contrast, real good in society occurs through organizations of individuals who have a purpose, and who have NO ability to shoot you for not participating. Children are fed and taken care of, poor villages are given livestock, our impact on the environment is lessened, and racial and gender equality is achieved through the work of individuals who believe in what they do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The legitimate structures and organizations in society work through voluntary effort, compensation and cooperation, and a belief in humanity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Government works through force and evil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-micah&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/why-the-lego-batman-movie-might-save-civilization/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/why-the-lego-batman-movie-might-save-civilization/</link><pubDate>Mon Feb 13 14:51:14 CST 2017</pubDate><title>Why the Lego Batman Movie might Save Civilization</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>The other day I saw [The Lego Batman Movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZSQTVdF3QM), a great addition to both the Batman movie franchise, and the Lego movie franchise.

It had action, adventure, drama, romance—and more cameos from familiar good guys, bad guys, and ambiguous guys than you can shake a stick at.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the first Lego Movie came out, I wrote about &lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/2014/05/27/theology-lego-movie"&gt;its deep theology&lt;/a&gt;. Now, I want to tell you why the Lego Batman Movie may save civilization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’ve paid attention to movies or TV shows in the last few decades, it’s hard to find one that has a positive view of technology. We all know the &lt;em&gt;Terminator&lt;/em&gt;, where futuristic technology is out to kill us, and &lt;em&gt;The Matrix&lt;/em&gt;, where technology has already made us its slaves. Then there’s more recent entries, like &lt;em&gt;Ex Machina&lt;/em&gt;, where a crazed Facebook founder dreams up ways to make an AI hate us, or &lt;em&gt;West World&lt;/em&gt;, where civilians torture robots for fun and pleasure, until the robots get other ideas. Even one of my favorite movies—Spike Jonze’s beautiful &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzV6mXIOVl4"&gt;Her&lt;/a&gt;, is a bittersweet lamentation on the plight of machines passing us by.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In these movies and shows, technology functions as an opponent and a threat. It either threatens our physical existence and freedom, or threatens our sense of who we are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is of deep concern, because as far as I can tell, there are only two options: technology or tyranny.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That may sound surprising, but it emerges from the very nature of things themselves. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tyranny is simply the triumph of &lt;em&gt;zero-sum thinking&lt;/em&gt;, the idea that for one person to win, another has to lose. This is the premise of games like chess, checkers, Monopoly—and on a larger scale, is an outlook that leads naturally into wars, cutthroat competition, and battles to the death. Steven Levy calls it the &lt;em&gt;win-lose scenario&lt;/em&gt;, James Carse calls it the &lt;em&gt;finite game&lt;/em&gt;, and Peter Thiel invokes Girard, and calls it &lt;em&gt;mimetic rivalry&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this approach to the world, there can never be enough. There are always a limited number of jobs, a finite supply of resources, and a fixed amount of wealth. Thus, giving opportunities to others means we lose them ourselves. Helping someone means hurting someone else, making space means kicking someone out, feeding the hungry means someone else will starve, staying safe means making bigger threats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this view of the world, there are always &lt;em&gt;winners&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;losers&lt;/em&gt;. And someone is always destined to be the biggest winner, to monopolize the greatest number of resources, to control the most power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thus, tyranny. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s not always appreciated about tyranny is that a tyrant always presides over a shrinking pie. He may be temporarily increasing the wealth flowing to him and his cronies—and perhaps even his whole country—but ultimately, it comes at the expense of vast reduction in overall resources. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Power, after all, does not come for free. It imposes a steep cost in human resources, both inside and outside the domain of the tyrant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The alternative is &lt;em&gt;non-zero-sum thinking&lt;/em&gt;, the idea that multiple people can win together—and win bigger than they ever could have alone. This is the premise of games like dress-up and pretend, and pretty much everything children play when left to themselves. On a larger scale, it is an outlook that leads naturally into trust, cooperation, co-ops, trade, mutually-beneficial arrangements, research and development, science, the internet, families, diplomacy, peace-making, and charity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Steven Levy calls it the &lt;em&gt;win-win scenario&lt;/em&gt;, Carse calls it the &lt;em&gt;infinite game&lt;/em&gt;, and Peter Thiel identifies this escape from Girard’s &lt;em&gt;mimetic rivalry&lt;/em&gt; as the one and only source of &lt;a href="http://amzn.to/2l0jZPi"&gt;zero-to-one&lt;/a&gt; innovation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this approach to the world, we’re only limited by our creativity. There is always enough, because our constraints are not defined by resources, but ingenuity. There are an infinite number of potential jobs, because we can always use another person contributing meaningfully to society. Wealth is not something fixed for all time, destined to be fought over by powerful people, but something that grows with the scale of society and the level of widespread cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This approach is defined by &lt;em&gt;technology&lt;/em&gt;—the creation of genuinely new possibilities.&lt;/strong&gt; Technology is the thing that unleashes others’ hidden potential, that manufactures new possibilities and new opportunities, that allows fewer and fewer resources to produce greater and greater output, that constantly expands the available “pie”, that allows new solutions to be discovered for ancient conflicts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this kind of world, we can give opportunities to others, knowing that this might end up creating new opportunities for ourselves. We can help someone out, knowing that doing so might make a more productive citizen, improve the local community, or unleash a chain of paying-it-forward. We can make space for someone new, knowing that this might create &lt;em&gt;new space&lt;/em&gt; for someone old. We can feed the hungry, knowing that this might be the thing that saves our village. And we can offer a helping hand, knowing that staying safe might mean replacing threats with willingness to help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this view of the world, the biggest winners are those who &lt;em&gt;create new things&lt;/em&gt;, and unleash the most potential in others. They are like Steve Jobs empowering a million burgeoning musicians, or Tim Berners-Lee, creating the world wide web, and bringing the world to our homes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They are our winners, they are our heroes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And they are idolized in almost no movies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Except the Lego Movies. &lt;strong&gt;In the Lego Movies, the heroes are the &lt;em&gt;master builders&lt;/em&gt;, the creative geniuses who can build anything—no instructions needed.&lt;/strong&gt; When Emmet from the first Lego Movie reached enlightenment, everything around him became a potential tool, a potential resource, a canvas on which he could create. Road debris could become a vehicle, scrap material could become a super-suit. In a sense, his whole environment stopped being inert, and &lt;em&gt;came alive&lt;/em&gt; with radical new potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same is true for Lego Batman. It’s a subtle point, but his power does not come from being a billionaire, from having a big mansion, or from possessing a lot of cool toys. Instead, it comes from his ability to create new things as needed, and to respond to new threats with new kinds of equipment and vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And so his Bat-Cave is not primarily a repository of tools waiting to be used, but a trophy room commemorating past battles, and all the creative efforts needed to overcome them. Rather than one Bat-Mobile, he seems to have hundreds, rather than one Bat-Suit, he seems to have thousands. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He relishes all of his possessions, but when it comes down to it, he simply creates a new vehicle to address the new situation he finds himself in. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And this is why these movies are so significant. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They celebrate the world as place bursting with radical creative potential. They celebrate heroes as the ones who allow their imaginations to take them farther than anyone has ever gone before. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s no accident that these movies are overflowing with friendship and humor and love. They occupy a world that is fundamentally &lt;em&gt;non-zero-sum&lt;/em&gt;, where everyone is deeply aware that life is an open-ended game, defined by creative, generative acts of imagination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lego Batman is a deeply flawed character, reveling in his own darkness and isolation. But from beginning to end, we know where his power comes from—the raw, pulsing energy at the heart of all creation. He is a master builder. He is a creator of new technologies. He looks at a city, and sees a landscape of infinite possibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a world of movies offering only a pessimistic future, with storylines full of cynicism about our creative ability, the Lego Movies are a light in the darkness, a shining beacon of hope in the night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that’s why Lego Batman is the hero we need.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2004/08/13/movie-rm/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2004/08/13/movie-rm/</link><pubDate>Fri Aug 13 02:31:00 CDT 2004</pubDate><title>MOVIE - RM</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>RM is an abbreviation that means something about being a Mormon missionary.

Never would have guessed that this would be a topic for a smart, irreverent, perfectly appropriate and family-friendly comedy that ranks up there with the best of today's (usually less than appropriate) comedies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What makes it great is the soundtrack, which consists of redone traditional hymns alongside punk-rock sing-alongs about being a missionary. The irony pushes the soundtrack into True Greatness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Somehow or another, this movie manages to make fun of everything about Mormons (and a lot of church people, in general), without being offensive or sacrilegious.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's not the greatest comedy, but it's brave, original, and worth watching for the shear pleasure of being able to talk about a movie about Mormons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mormons should like it too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;000 Three Cookies.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/11/21/1353556183/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/11/21/1353556183/</link><pubDate>Wed Nov 21 21:49:43 CST 2012</pubDate><title>1353556183</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>It is so improbable that we will pass out of existence forever.

Rather, the very structure of reality hints to us, suggests to us that we will continue, that existence stretches far beneath us, and that even if we are to fall out of this world, we will land in a reality more deep and nuanced than we can imagine. There is no other probability, really, and the more we discover, the bigger and dramatically more complex the universe begins to be seen.

The author and main character, Neal Donald Walsh, claims to have heard from God over an extended period of time. In these conversations, God showed him that most religious concerns are irrelevant. I am with him on this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;God makes these main points:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;li&gt;We are all One.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;li&gt;There's Enough.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;li&gt;There's Nothing We Have to Do.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;li&gt;Ours Is Not A Better Way, Ours Is Merely Another Way.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Given the appropriate context and meaning, I'm with him on all these as well. In the grand scheme of things, there is nothing that really &lt;em&gt;needs&lt;/em&gt; to be done. But, given this, what does he suggest as the primary principle of life?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I understand him, it's simply to do "whatever works". There is no right way to accomplish something; we simply need to make the choices that will lead to our desired result the most quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I actually think that this is a somewhat reasonable basis for morality, if that's what we're looking for. But it doesn't really help us much. It doesn't tell us anything we don't know. It doesn't help us decide whether to kill a particular individual or not - since we can't know the future, we can only guess as to whether killing that person will lead us to the results we want.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a basis for living, then, this is a workable method, but not a brilliant one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, Jesus offers us something else. Jesus doesn't ask us to guess at the future. Jesus doesn't ask us to make leaps of logic in order to determine our actions now. Instead, Jesus is incisively and brilliantly simple. Whatever you want - be that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want peace, be peaceful. If you want love, be loving. According to Jesus, we cannot separate our ends from our means. We cannot pursue peace through violence, we cannot achieve love through hatred. "Whoever lives by the sword will die by the sword" - whatever means we choose will always be present in the ends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And so, for Jesus, we must live from a deeply burning integrity, regardless of the result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jesus, in my understanding, asks us to look deeply into each moment and decision, and determine what is intrinsically desirable there. Not, "What can we stomach now, to get what we want later?" But rather, "What decision at this moment most fully and authentically comes from me?" Or, "What do I value most deeply?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his provocative way, Jesus asks us to ignore "whatever works", and to turn our focus instead on whatever &lt;em&gt;is &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;beautiful&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2008/05/22/starbucks-in-the-middle-east/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2008/05/22/starbucks-in-the-middle-east/</link><pubDate>Thu May 22 22:11:00 CDT 2008</pubDate><title>Starbucks in the Middle East</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>Today I went to Starbucks.

This was a Starbucks on a last-stop base in Kuwait, where soldiers come before finally reaching Iraq. My brother came through here when he went through his deployment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've gone more than 25 days without Starbucks, and now the ability to drink something familiar was an escape - an escape from the Arabic world I've been in for almost a month. Being 6000 miles from home for an extended period of time is something like being on a spaceship - when I'm at home, if I want something, I only have to drive minutes (at most, hours) to reach it. But here, there's nothing I can do. If they don't have something I want, there's nothing I can do to reach it. If I started panicking, and wanted to go home, there's nothing I can do. If I needed contacts, or special guitar equipment, or some rare tools, there's nowhere to go. Even indoor restrooms aren't something taken for granted here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm in the desert, over 6000 miles from home, in a place where I've been warned not to venture far. There are anti-American communities nearby, and we stand out like a sore thumb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Starbucks is like an escape, like getting to temporarily step outside the space capsule through a magic doorway, back into my neighborhood. And then walking back through the door and returning to the confined bubble thousands of miles from home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I ordered my normal drink, and sat inside the Starbucks looking out the windows at the blast barricades surrounding it.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2010/04/14/night-sky/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2010/04/14/night-sky/</link><pubDate>Wed Apr 14 23:12:52 CDT 2010</pubDate><title>Night Sky</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>Tonight I looked up at the clouds, and the sky beyond them, and the stars beyond that.

There are parts of this universe that seem meant for us to explore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And I think that we will, that our lives will stretch out in front of us, and we will continue outward and upward into the vastness.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2010/02/08/dealing-with-intense-disagreement-about-beliefs/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2010/02/08/dealing-with-intense-disagreement-about-beliefs/</link><pubDate>Mon Feb 08 19:01:00 CST 2010</pubDate><title>Dealing with intense disagreement about beliefs</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>There are a variety of views on homosexuality, and that's the truth.

To be rough and general, three of these perspectives are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div&gt;1) Being gay is an abomination&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;2) I don't necessarily think that homosexuality is good, but I can love the person anyway&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;3) Gay is great! &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think about these as views on alcohol. One person thinks drinking is a horrible sin, another doesn't really like drinking but loves drinkers anyway, and yet another thinks drinking is wonderful. That these viewpoints exists is a definite fact, and is probably not going to change anytime soon. What can we do about these different perspectives?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can love one another. If we really do that, no one needs to change in order for us to do what we are supposed to be doing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beliefs and activities are individual decisions. When I decide to go 5 miles over the speed limit, that's a decision I've made, concluding in my own mind that speeding is not a sin. You can drag out Romans 13, etc, etc...but that's not likely to change my mind about whether speeding is wrong. Others may feel like going even 5 miles over is not acceptable, while still others may choose to drive 95 mph everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If someone has been given all the relevant facts and arguments, then the decision is theirs to make, and is no longer in our hands. And what do we do when others have made up their mind differently than we have?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We love them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jesus' disciples faced far greater challenges in the first century. Around the Roman Empire, Paul was bringing slaves and slave-holders together under one roof, as &lt;i&gt;equals&lt;/i&gt;. Paul didn't like slavery, but it was a fact, and Paul was powerless to abolish it. What he could do, however, was testify to the underlying equality of all the people he was bringing together, convincing even slave-holders to show love and respect towards the slaves, and allowing slaves to show forgiveness to even slave-masters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What Paul didn't do was pretend that everybody thought the same. The slave-holders felt justified in keeping their slaves, at least for awhile. And the slaves felt justified in not being kept. Despite that, Paul said, love each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So today, we are bringing together people who feel homosexuality is an abomination, and those who feel it is a wonderful lifestyle. We are putting together moderates, conservatives, and liberals under one roof.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The one thing we should all be able to agree on is that we are to love. And we love, whether that person drinks, is a drug addict, wants to date in a bizarre fashion, or feels differently than we do.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2005/05/07/che-zuro-at-rendezvous/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2005/05/07/che-zuro-at-rendezvous/</link><pubDate>Sat May 07 13:51:00 CDT 2005</pubDate><title>Che Zuro at Rendezvous</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>On Tuesday, we hosted Che Zuro at Rendezvous House of Coffee in Teays Valley.

This led me to a lot of study and research, and ultimately to the reluctant conclusion that &lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/series/apocalypse"&gt;New Testament eschatology ended in the first century&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I say reluctant because I already had my own framework through which I viewed eschatology, and I wasn't looking for a replacement. But the sheer mountain of evidence was irresistible. The second coming had been predicted for sometime circa AD 70, and if I was to hold any confidence in the scriptures, I must conclude that it had really happened just as they had anticipated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Naturally, this required a lot of productive research, and I gradually discovered the scriptural genre of apocalyptic language, the importance of audience relevance, and the need to interpret within the historical context of the writings themselves. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scriptures came alive with a depth of meaning and nuance I couldn't have imagined before. And I could suddenly see that far from being a rejection of the earth and physical existence, the bible was concerned with the reclamation of them both. The scriptures weren't looking for the dissolution of the physical universe, but for a change in the relation of God and man, human and human. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fulfilled eschatology had given me back the world. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there was a problem. If the second coming had happened in AD 70, then the resurrection had occurred at the same time. And that meant that the resurrection didn’t involve bodies coming out of graves, but was something that had happened in the spiritual realm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I didn’t see a problem with this biblically — but it worried me philosophically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traditional theology had gone down this road before. There were two viewpoints — one which held that resurrection was about the soul entering heaven, and one which held that resurrection was about restoring God’s creation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Jews had always believed that God would restore creation and enact justice on the earth. The idea of resurrection was just an extension of that - just as they had trusted God to bring them back from captivity, they trusted that God would restore the lives of the righteous dead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was usually envisioned as bodies rising from the dust, graves opening, and so forth. The dead would be restored to the same realm that they had been removed from. And so the future of the dead, the future of human society, and the future of the world were all intertwined. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That belief served to help people focus on doing right and creating justice within their own communities. God was working on setting the earth to rights, and they would too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, there was the idea of the soul entering heaven. Those who adopted this viewpoint tended to believe that earthly life was profane and base, while the afterlife was holy and glorious. Since those who died were entering another realm, never to return, the future of individuals and the future of human society were separate things entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This belief often ended up encouraging people to develop a lax attitude towards injustices and world problems. With God, the dead, and our future all tied up in another realm, why be concerned about the way things are here when you leave?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Christianity had entertained both of these perspectives. But in positing that the resurrection had occurred entirely in the first century, fulfilled eschatology was pushing us firmly into the latter camp. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So with one hand, fulfilled eschatology was giving me back a concern for the world and the development of human society, and with the other hand, it was taking it away. We criticized traditional theology for its escapist notions of destroying the world and being whipped away into the sky, but by insisting on this entirely other-worldly afterlife, we were creating our own sort of escapism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, not everybody's theology worked out quite that way, but a lot of it did. As that thinking progressed, people seemed to split into two camps: those who were more concerned with the spiritual realm, and those who were more concerned with the physical one. If there are two separate realms of existence, it seems that one cannot serve both masters. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who were more concerned with the physical realm began to downplay, and in some cases deny, the concept of resurrection or immortality. Those who were more concerned with the spiritual realm began to downplay, and in some cases deny, the importance of biblical history, and history in general.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both of them began to sound increasingly hollow to me. Something seemed wrong— on the one hand, the bible's overwhelming focus on restoration and justice on earth; on the other hand, the bible's seeming insistence that the resurrection belonged to the first century. There was a deep irony to this: A first century apocalypse was an apocalypse concerned with the ongoing physical world, but a first century resurrection was not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was at an intellectual impasse, confused and conflicted. So I stepped back and began to think about what the biblical story was telling us on other levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I gradually began to notice that the scriptures weren't just the account of one apocalypse, but of dozens - from the ark to the Exodus story and beyond. The apocalyptic, in fact, wasn't just a way of talking about events to come - it was an outlook on history itself, an outlook that grew from the belief in a God of justice and truth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The biblical God is both &lt;em&gt;ultimate reality&lt;/em&gt;, and a being involved in the created world. This means that his attributes are the primary factors in history, the primary factors in any human interaction or society. Truth, justice, and freedom are aspects of God, and so they are always rising, always pushing themselves into our existence. God &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt;, and so history must bend towards the good, and justice must increase without end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These realities could be resisted, but they could not be resisted forever. Powerful empires could rise up and enslave people, kings could stand against truth and justice, but all these things must eventually come to end, swallowed up by the nature of existence itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the heart of the Israelite’s cry for freedom from the Egyptians, the heart of the prophet’s cry for relief from oppression. They believed that justice must come, that it could not be stopped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The moment when this happens, when lies are overwhelmed by truth, is the judgment and the apocalypse. Those who have resisted reality, will be undone. Those who have embraced reality, will be vindicated. The structures of oppression and falsehood and injustice will be burned to the ground — sometimes literally. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who see the truth and stand on the side of God and of history will suffer as they wait for their moment of vindication. In giving up the current realities for the coming reality, they make themselves strangers to the world they inhabit, citizens of the world that is coming. They suffer, to be vindicated in the coming future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, those who reject the truth and stand against the movement of God and of history are able to flourish temporarily. But the more they resist the oncoming reality, the more severe their eventual encounter with the truth. They prosper temporarily, to be devastated in the coming future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The important thing here is that this is not just one event in the biblical narrative - it is the arc of history. The rise of freedom and justice is unending, and as they rise, bastions of injustice and oppression collapse in their wake. Every collapse is a new apocalyptic moment, a moment of judgment in which those who have committed themselves to the truth inherit the new world that is rising. This is the situation in Exodus, it is the situation in the prophets, it is the situation in the New Testament. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fulfilled eschatology was right. The New Testament is concerned with an apocalypse that happened in their generation, forever changing the course of history and the world. But this wasn’t the end of eschatology, just as the Exodus wasn’t the end of Israelite history. This was the start of a bigger eschatology, an eschatology that is drawing in the entire universe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traditional eschatology and fulfilled eschatology both got it wrong in assuming that there was going to one big cataclysmic event, and that would be the end. The reality is that every end is the beginning of something bigger, something grander, something more brilliant and cataclysmic and glorious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And we’ve only seen the beginning of that eternal process.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/09/12/some-simulation-argument-flowcharts/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/09/12/some-simulation-argument-flowcharts/</link><pubDate>Wed Sep 12 01:50:53 CDT 2012</pubDate><title>Some Simulation Argument flowcharts</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>The simulation argument conversation.

So I'm running with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I believe that the Apocalypse, Armageddon, the Second Coming of Jesus, Judgment Day, the Resurrection, and the New Jerusalem have ALREADY come. The world-shattering events that terrify so many people have already happened, and are behind us now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And I believe this is a straight-forward conclusion of taking the Bible seriously, and attempting to read it as the original hearers did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm going to use THREE main scriptural facts to demonstrate this. While we could debate the finer points of eschatology for the rest of our lives, I'm happy just to know the overall story, and I think these three facts can tell us what that is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But first, read &lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/series/interpreting-bible"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;, for my take on how we are to interpret the bible. I don't think we can &lt;em&gt;prove&lt;/em&gt; massive viewpoints like this one. I think we have to evaluate whether any given viewpoint explains the facts &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;worse&lt;/em&gt; than the other viewpoints offered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE END IS NEAR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The End is Near" is a cliche in our culture. For decades now, people have been walking the streets carrying signs, proclaiming this scary "truth" to us. We've come to expect it from religious figures. So when reading about Jesus, we might miss just how &lt;em&gt;urgent&lt;/em&gt; he really was.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Jesus started his ministry just like John did, by declaring "Repent! For the Kingdom of God is at hand!" And he really meant it. Early on, we hear "flee from the wrath to come!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jesus was announcing an impending judgment, not something that might happen thousands of years in the future. He reaches his most definitive when he states:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Truly I say to you, there are &lt;span class="textsearch"&gt;some&lt;/span&gt; of those who are STANDING HERE who will not taste death until they see the Son of Man coming in His kingdom." (Matthew 16:28, Mark 9:1, Luke 9:27)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Truly I say to you, THIS &lt;span class="textsearch"&gt;generation&lt;/span&gt; will not &lt;span class="textsearch"&gt;pass&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="textsearch"&gt;away&lt;/span&gt; until ALL THESE THINGS take place." (Matthew 24:34, Mark 13:30, Luke 21:32) &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He had just been talking about his second coming, and when his disciples asked when it would happen, he told them THEIR GENERATION WOULD LIVE TO SEE IT. Some of the people who heard Jesus teach would live to see his return.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When telling his disciples what to do after his death, he tells them to keep moving, no matter what. Why? Because they've got a lot of ground to cover, and not much time:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Assuredly, I say to you, you will not have gone through the cities of Israel before the Son of Man comes. (Matthew 10:23)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This theme only gets stronger through the rest of the New Testament. When Peter stands up at Pentecost, he explains to the crowd what the miracles they were seeing were all about:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Then Peter stood up with the Eleven, raised his voice and addressed the crowd: "Fellow Jews and all of you who live in Jerusalem, let me explain this to you; listen carefully to what I say. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://studylight.org/desk/?query=ac+2:15&amp;amp;sr=1&amp;amp;t=niv"&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;These men are not drunk, as you suppose. It's only nine in the morning! &lt;strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://studylight.org/desk/?query=ac+2:16&amp;amp;sr=1&amp;amp;t=niv"&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;No, THIS IS WHAT was spoken by the prophet Joel:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://studylight.org/desk/?query=ac+2:17&amp;amp;sr=1&amp;amp;t=niv"&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;" 'In the LAST DAYS, God says,&lt;br/&gt;I will pour out my Spirit on all people.&lt;br/&gt;Your sons and daughters will prophesy,&lt;br/&gt;your young men will see visions,&lt;br/&gt;your old men will dream dreams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://studylight.org/desk/?query=ac+2:18&amp;amp;sr=1&amp;amp;t=niv"&gt;18&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Even on my servants, both men and women,&lt;br/&gt;I will pour out my Spirit in those days,&lt;br/&gt;and they will prophesy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://studylight.org/desk/?query=ac+2:19&amp;amp;sr=1&amp;amp;t=niv"&gt;19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;I will show wonders in the heaven above&lt;br/&gt;and signs on the earth below,&lt;br/&gt;blood and fire and billows of smoke.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://studylight.org/desk/?query=ac+2:20&amp;amp;sr=1&amp;amp;t=niv"&gt;20&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;The sun will be turned to darkness&lt;br/&gt;and the moon to blood&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; before the coming of the great and glorious day of the Lord.&lt;br/&gt;(Acts 2:14-20)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The signs they were doing were fulfilling the prophecy of Joel, and the prophecy of Joel was all about what would happen in the "last days", just prior to the Day of The Lord. And Peter says that he and his friends had just kicked off the Last Days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You would expect that if a great catastrophe was looming (called "The Day of The Lord"), you would become more and more urgent as that event approached. That is in fact what did happen. If Jesus announced it was near, within his generation, and if Peter declared that they were in the Last Days, John declared first that it was the LAST DAY, and then the LAST HOUR.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="contextverse"&gt;Children, it is the last hour; and just as you heard that antichrist is coming, even now many antichrists have appeared; from this we know that it is the last hour. (&lt;/span&gt;1 John 2:18-19&lt;span class="contextverse"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prophet Daniel received a vision of The End, and was told to seal it up, because the time was far away. Approximately 490 years later, John re-opened that vision. But this time, he was told NOT to seal it up, because the time was short.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Was he expecting "short" to mean 2000 more years?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; THE TWO SONS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's no doubt in my mind that the apostles and prophets of the New Testament believed the Second Coming would happen in their lifetimes. And they believed that they got this information from Jesus himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CS Lewis knew this. He said that Jesus had plainly and clearly been wrong. CS Lewis didn't have any trouble seeing that the Second Coming was expected to happen in the first century. He had trouble understanding WHAT the Second Coming was.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHAT was Jesus saying would happen? What was the significance of the Second Coming, and why was it so important that it happen SOON? If they expected something to come so quickly, WHAT were they expecting?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, Paul tells us exactly how he saw the last days he was living in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by the slave woman and the other by the free woman. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://studylight.org/desk/?query=ga+4:23&amp;amp;sr=1&amp;amp;t=niv"&gt;23&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;His son by the slave woman was born in the ordinary way; but his son by the free woman was born as the result of a promise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://studylight.org/desk/?query=ga+4:24&amp;amp;sr=1&amp;amp;t=niv"&gt;24&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;These things may be taken figuratively, for the women represent two covenants. One covenant is from Mount Sinai and bears children who are to be slaves: This is Hagar. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://studylight.org/desk/?query=ga+4:25&amp;amp;sr=1&amp;amp;t=niv"&gt;25&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Now Hagar stands for Mount Sinai in Arabia and corresponds to the present city of Jerusalem, because she is in slavery with her children. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://studylight.org/desk/?query=ga+4:26&amp;amp;sr=1&amp;amp;t=niv"&gt;26&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;But the Jerusalem that is above is free, and she is our mother. (Galatians 4:22-26)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Jewish identity had been built on this story. But Paul is now reversing it, looking at the deeper principles. Abraham fathered his first child through his slave, Hagar. His second child, the son of promise, was fathered through Sarah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This story illustrates a couple of principles. One, God works through God's means. Abraham's attempt to fulfill God's promises through his own efforts (by fathering a child through Hagar) was doomed to failure. It was the miraculous son (through Sarah), that God would use to fulfill his promises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two, the biblical order is from death to life, from slavery to freedom. This is why God exalts the lesser, the second-born, the barren.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paul shows that these principles are being played out here. God's real ambition was to create a new covenant, and a spiritual Israel. Man's efforts to create God's kingdom through temples and warfare would ultimately fail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So the "Son Of Promise" was Paul and the body of Christ. They were the children of "Sarah", the New Covenant, the Jerusalem from above. And the "Son of Slavery" was the current Israel. They were the children of "Hagar", the Old Covenant, the Jerusalem from below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Now you, brothers, like Isaac, are children of promise. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://studylight.org/desk/?query=ga+4:29&amp;amp;sr=1&amp;amp;t=niv"&gt;29&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;At that time the son born in the ordinary way persecuted the son born by the power of the Spirit. It is the same now. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://studylight.org/desk/?query=ga+4:30&amp;amp;sr=1&amp;amp;t=niv"&gt;30&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;But what does the Scripture say? "Get rid of the slave woman and her son, for the slave woman's son will never share in the inheritance with the free woman's son."&lt;a name="BF17" href="http://studylight.org/desk/?query=ga+4&amp;amp;t=niv&amp;amp;st=1&amp;amp;new=1&amp;amp;l=en#F17"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://studylight.org/desk/?query=ga+4:31&amp;amp;sr=1&amp;amp;t=niv"&gt;31&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Therefore, brothers, we are not children of the slave woman, but of the free woman. (Galatians 4:28-31)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is the big picture. God was going to create a new humanity. Which "son" would this happen through? Which "son" would inherit God's promises? God had two children: a physical, fleshly nation, and a spiritual, heavenly nation. The "mothers" of those children were the two covenants: a physical, fleshly covenant, and a spiritual, heavenly covenant. One kept people enslaved. One set people free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But BOTH were from God, just like both Isaac and Ishmael were sons of Abraham. And only one could inherit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the story of Ishmael and Isaac, there is an overlap. Ishmael is born, and lives in Abraham's house. Later, Isaac is born. Isaac and Ishmael live side by side for a while. But Ishmael realizes that Isaac is going to take his place, and so torments Isaac. Eventually, Ishmael and his mother are cast out, leaving Isaac free to inherit the promises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until Ishmael was cast out, Isaac was never free to be the heir, because Ishmael was the first-born. Only at the casting-out of Ishmael is Isaac recognized as the full heir.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paul tells his friends that this was exactly the situation they were in. The Old Covenant came from God, and with it, the Old Israel. Then God created a New Covenant and a New Israel, beginning with Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a time, BOTH existed together, each with rival claims to being God's chosen son. And so Old Israel tormented the New Israel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Paul tells them not to worry. Their tormentors were going to be cast out, and when they were, the New Israel would be free to inherit the promises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So Paul looks forward to both a physical and a spiritual release. At the casting-out of Old Israel, their physical tormentor would be gone. But on a deeper level, God would have shown that the New Israel was his true son, the son of promise. Only THEN would Paul and his audience really be free to enjoy the full inheritance of the New Covenant. Only THEN would it be clear who God's chosen people were. Only then would they truly be free from condemnation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We tend to assume that the Old Covenant went away at the cross. But to Paul, the cross was the start of the New Covenant. The presence of the New Covenant meant the Old Covenant was about to pass away (Hebrews 8:13), but the Old Covenant was &lt;em&gt;still there&lt;/em&gt;, condemning, standing between man and God. As long as the temple was standing, the way to God could not be fully known (Hebrews 9:8).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fall of the temple meant the Law and condemnation were taken away, and full access to God made available. And THAT is what they were looking for, and why it was so important that it happen SOON.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; THE END OF THE STORY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revelation is a very complex, symbolic book. Almost no one claims to understand everything in it. But we don't need to understand everything in it to understand its point. If you want to know what a book is about, skip to the ending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I saw the Holy City, the new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride beautifully dressed for her husband. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://studylight.org/desk/?query=re+21:3&amp;amp;sr=1&amp;amp;t=niv"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, "Now the dwelling of God is with men, and he will live with them. They will be his people, and God himself will be with them and be their God..." (Revelation 21:2-3)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revelation ends with the New Jerusalem. Many people see this as symbolic of heaven. But the scriptures make clear, this New Jerusalem is coming FROM HEAVEN, TO EARTH. It does not represent an after-death reality, but something that humanity can experience on the ground. The New Jerusalem represents the fact that God is now fully present with humanity, on earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;One of the seven angels who had the seven bowls full of the seven last plagues came and said to me, "Come, I will show you the bride, the wife of the Lamb." &lt;strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://studylight.org/desk/?query=re+21:10&amp;amp;sr=1&amp;amp;t=niv"&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;And he carried me away in the Spirit to a mountain great and high, and showed me the Holy City, Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God. (Revelation 21:9-10)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If it wasn't clear before, the identity of this New Jerusalem is explicitly stated here. This New Jerusalem (or, the Jerusalem from above, which Paul claimed to be part of) is the &lt;em&gt;bride of Christ&lt;/em&gt;. Instead of a physical city to be set up or a sideways reference to heaven, this is talking about the victory of the New Covenant and the New Israel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It had a great, high wall with twelve gates, and with twelve angels at the gates. On the gates were written the names of the twelve tribes of Israel. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://studylight.org/desk/?query=re+21:13&amp;amp;sr=1&amp;amp;t=niv"&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;There were three gates on the east, three on the north, three on the south and three on the west. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://studylight.org/desk/?query=re+21:14&amp;amp;sr=1&amp;amp;t=niv"&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;The wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them were the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb. (Revelation 21:12-14)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To drill the point home, we're told that this New Jerusalem is founded on the apostles, and draws from the original tribes of Israel. We're being given a very clear reference to the 1st-century followers of Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I did not see a temple in the city, because the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are its temple. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://studylight.org/desk/?query=re+21:23&amp;amp;sr=1&amp;amp;t=niv"&gt;23&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;The city does not need the sun or the moon to shine on it, for the glory of God gives it light, and the Lamb is its lamp. (Revelation 21:22-23)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Far from a physical city needing physical lighting, this city is a spiritual reality whose only source of light is God himself. It doesn't even need a physical building for use as a temple, because &lt;em&gt;being inside God&lt;/em&gt; is the only temple needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The nations will walk by its light, and the kings of the earth will bring their splendor into it. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://studylight.org/desk/?query=re+21:25&amp;amp;sr=1&amp;amp;t=niv"&gt;25&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;On no day will its gates ever be shut, for there will be no night there. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://studylight.org/desk/?query=re+21:26&amp;amp;sr=1&amp;amp;t=niv"&gt;26&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;The glory and honor of the nations will be brought into it. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://studylight.org/desk/?query=re+21:27&amp;amp;sr=1&amp;amp;t=niv"&gt;27&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Nothing impure will ever enter it, nor will anyone who does what is shameful or deceitful, but only those whose names are written in the Lamb's book of life. (Romans 21:24-27)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The nations will walk by its light". If this was a post-death heaven, there would be no nations around. Instead, this is referring to the New Covenant, now victorious on earth, fulfilling its purpose of being a light to the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its gates are always open, because the invitation to enter into God's rest is always there. If this were a post-death heaven, who would be left to enter in? Instead, this is a reality on the earth, and as the nations see its truth, they bring their glory and honor into it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The end result of the biblical story isn't the destruction of planet Earth, or the journey to heaven. The end result is instead the victory of God and his people and his covenant. In that victory, the New Covenant is established as an eternal covenant, which is always open, always inviting. It is the spiritual reality of the marriage of God and man, of Christ and his &lt;em&gt;ecclesia&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that spiritual reality is here &lt;em&gt;NOW&lt;/em&gt;. God lives with humanity, continually inviting all to come and rest with him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It Happened&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In AD 70, approximately 40 years after the death of Jesus and 2-4 years after Revelation was written, all things prophesied came to pass. Between AD 66 and AD 73, a man known as a beast attempted to destroy Christianity, the dynasty of the Caesars came to a violent end, millions of Jews around the world were killed, the entire Roman Empire was shaken to its core, and the two greatest temples in the world (the temple of Jupiter in Rome and the Temple of Yahweh in Jerusalem) burned to the ground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More significantly, False Messiahs stood up in the Jewish Temple and called on God to grant them supernatural victory, as they started the war which they correctly believed would initiate The Day of Judgment. Unfortunately, they were on the wrong side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thousands of Jews from all over the world streamed to Jerusalem to take part in the Great Rebellion. And the Roman armies marched on Jerusalem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Christians saw Jesus' signs being fulfilled, and fled to the mountains. The rest of the Jews ignored the warnings, as the opportunity for escape passed them by. Locked inside the city of Jerusalem, False Messiahs battled each other, brutally killing thousands upon thousands of Jews who were deemed not faithful enough. The blood of this slaughter poured out of the temple and streamed down the streets of Jerusalem, an abomination worse than any in history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The end result was obvious to anyone not engulfed in spiritual blindness. The armies of Rome waited for Israel to decimate herself, then plunged in and burned it to the ground. The Jewish Temple burned on the exact day that Solomon's Temple was destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar, 656 years earlier. Over a million Jews were killed, 97,000 were led into slavery, and around the empire, hundreds of thousands were slaughtered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Old Covenant world that had rejected God's revelation went down into fiery destruction. Jews who had put their hope in the temple and in their false prophets were cut off, their access to God revoked. The Christians who had heeded Jesus' warnings were seen as the true heirs of God's covenant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Titus, the Roman leader, reportedly refused to accept a wreath of victory, as there is "no merit in vanquishing people forsaken by their own God".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The destruction was massive and agonizing. But the fall of the Temple meant the fall of everything that obstructed the way into God's presence. The barriers to God came dramatically tumbling down, leaving only God's holy city, the new spiritual Jerusalem, pristine and unblemished, opening her doors to the new world.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2007/03/27/metaphors-or-back-from-pittsburgh/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2007/03/27/metaphors-or-back-from-pittsburgh/</link><pubDate>Tue Mar 27 15:00:00 CDT 2007</pubDate><title>Metaphors, or "Back from Pittsburgh"</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>We spent a long weekend in Pittsburgh attending the APCA conference, and meeting a lot of wonderful people.

It was a very enlightening experience, and I talked to people who had been performing at colleges for longer than I've been alive, people who graduated from Berklee, people who went to circus school in England, and just some nice folks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After we were done, we did an afternoon performance at a Borders store, and talked to an interesting couple named "My" and "River".&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is a link to &lt;a href="http://riverschihouse.blogspot.com/2007/03/congratulations-you-did-it.html"&gt;River's blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I try to learn from people I meet in many different circumstances. I think it's easy to dismiss people and their ideas when they use different language to describe their thoughts; so I make an effort to think more deeply about what they are saying, and to understand the metaphors they use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We all use metaphors. Language is metaphor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But sometimes we pick our culture, and pick our metaphors, and other types of metaphors aren't allowed to enter in. While I don't use certain types of metaphors in my speech or thought, it does not mean that I cannot recognize those metaphors as being valuable in other people's thoughts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In whatever frame of reference we hold, we tend to take our metaphors as literal, and other people's metaphors as figurative. But everything we think or talk about is a metaphor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"A rising star in American politics", "A brilliant man", "A scientific revolution", "Coming down with a cold", "Having a fever", etc, etc...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just some thoughts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-micah&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2005/07/23/wisdom-from-the-green-shag-carpet-finally-released/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2005/07/23/wisdom-from-the-green-shag-carpet-finally-released/</link><pubDate>Sat Jul 23 13:14:00 CDT 2005</pubDate><title>"Wisdom from the Green Shag Carpet" Finally Released!</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>The all-new full-length CD from the Redding Brothers, entitled "Wisdom from the Green Shag Carpet", has finally been released.

The release party was held at the Borders Cafe last night and was a huge success. We were honored by the presence of the wonderful local singer-songwriter Bug Lilly (&lt;a href="http://www.myspace.com/buggamile" target="_blank"&gt;www.myspace.com/buggamile&lt;/a&gt;), who did an excellent performance to open the show, after which the new CD was officially released. The Redding Brothers explained the background of the album and then played a 50 minute set. Three separate drawings for free merchandise were held during the show, one for a T-shirt, one for a poster, button &amp;amp; sticker set, and the grand prize drawing for the new "Wisdom from the Green Shag Carpet" CD. The new CD can be purchased in our &lt;a href="http://www.reddingbrothers.com/store/"&gt;online store&lt;/a&gt; here on the website, by clicking the "&lt;a href="http://www.reddingbrothers.com/store/"&gt;store&lt;/a&gt;" link at the top of the page. Thanks to everyone who helped out with our CD Release Party, especially to the Borders Cafe staff, Bug Lilly, Tiffany, Steve (for coming to our CD Release Party even after a long trip :-), Reda, and to everyone who helped out.

In the past, these were seen as characteristics that decent people should possess. Men worked physically demanding jobs, women managed houses. Men played sports, women took up quiet hobbies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, I'm oversimplifying. These characteristics have always been in flux. The ancient agricultural societies expected both men and women to work at home; with the industrial revolution, it became a "man" thing to leave home and work in the city, while the woman kept the house, or idled away her time. The slight cultural controversy in the 20th century over women having careers is amusing, simply because a hundred years earlier, &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;no one&lt;/span&gt; had careers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That these patterns change so much is evidence that they are just that: patterns, not fixed measurements of behavior. And as time goes on, they fluctuate more and more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many times these fluctuations become their own patterns. At a certain point in time, being good at sports was a distinct virtue. Not being good at sports meant your future wasn't going to be that bright. But certain people rebelled against that mold, and geeks, nerds, and musicians took on their own identities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being a computer geek has a definite masculine flavor, and yet is focused on "soft skills", skills that have little to do with traditional masculine patterns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being a "rock star" is considered the height of status in our culture, and yet, being a rock star usually means being the opposite of sports "jocks", possibly having ambiguous gender identifiers, and being advanced at the "soft skill" of conveying emotions through music.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are all patterns - patterns you can use or break as desired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just because something is a pattern does not mean it should be discarded. Traditional masculine and feminine roles are sometimes useful and beneficial. Concepts like "being a provider", or "bringing home the bacon", can give a productive focus to one's activities. People often enjoy more traditional role-play while they are courting, with men often taking on the suitor role, and women taking on the role of the one being sought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These patterns are useful, because they help us define boundaries within which to let our creativity and personality take form.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2005/06/13/free-ipod/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2005/06/13/free-ipod/</link><pubDate>Mon Jun 13 23:10:00 CDT 2005</pubDate><title>Free iPod!</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>Yep.

Two years ago, I lost my grandfather from the other side. This is what I wrote at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;— &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My grandfather died in December. For me and my siblings, this was the first real “death in the family”, and it was a lot of new experiences and new stresses and new awkward situations. His heart stopped for 30 minutes, and then we had 5 days of waiting in the hospital, trying to find out what was going to happen, and trying to be there for my grandmother, and trying to be there for my grandfather in whatever way was still possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was hyper-conscious of religion in this situation, because some of my family are very religious, and some of my family are not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few of them had a really hard time being in the room with him, because it was hard to see him that way, unconscious and swollen. But for whatever reason, I did want to be in the room. I wanted to be there with that real person, in that real situation. I didn’t want to just “remember him as he was”. That in its own way would be a sort of concession to death, a sort of rejection of the life that was still there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I very much admired my grandmother through this whole process. She fought for his life, even when it became apparent that if he did regain consciousness, he probably wouldn’t regain full independence. Even when it became apparent that he would probably struggle with brain damage, and all the intense difficulties that would entail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I admired her, because she so clearly valued his life, to whatever degree it was possible. I didn’t feel like this was just being afraid to let go, or holding on to something symbolic and unreal…I felt like she was quite ready for whatever “life after heart stoppage” would mean.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When they finally told us that there was no brain activity, and no chance of him regaining brain activity, she asked her children to help her make the decision, and then sat with him the entire night, holding his hand for as long as she could.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During this whole process, a lot of scriptures were read, and a lot of songs were sung, and a lot of encouraging things were said. To me, most of them felt glib — like they were disconnected from the reality of what was happening in front of us. But this passage from &lt;a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Job+19%3A25-27&amp;version=NIV"&gt;Job&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know that my redeemer lives,&lt;br/&gt;and that in the end he will stand on the earth.&lt;br/&gt;And after my skin has been destroyed,&lt;br/&gt;yet in my flesh I will see God;&lt;br/&gt;I myself will see him&lt;br/&gt;with my own eyes—I, and not another. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;For some reason, that resonated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m mostly familiar with this passage as part of the debate over whether we are resurrected as spirits or as flesh—people argue over whether it says “in my flesh” or “out of my flesh”. But I think that was the farthest thing from the author’s mind. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The passage is about who we are, and our deep and never-ending hunger for connection. It’s about that yearning for connection reaching beyond our limits, our place and situation; the first experience of life, and the last experience in death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I myself will see him; with my own eyes — I, and not another.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2010/04/16/the-structure-of-human-hope-in-the-first-century/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2010/04/16/the-structure-of-human-hope-in-the-first-century/</link><pubDate>Fri Apr 16 20:54:03 CDT 2010</pubDate><title>The Structure of Human Hope: in the first century</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>In my previous post, I outlined what I think reality must be like in order for human hope to persist.

"The kingdom of God is near!" is one of the first lines in the gospels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The change that was coming was in contrast to the world that then existed. While the first century world was based on divisions between ethnicities and social classes, and centered around institutions like the temple, the government, and the priesthood, the new world that was beginning would be based on equality and human relationships. This contrast could not have been more intense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One world-view was built on illusion and pretension, another was built on a deep awareness of reality. The way the early Jesus-movement saw it, their cause was bound to win, because reality was behind them. And since their cause was going to win, their opponents either needed to become aware of reality, or they were going to receive a painful wakeup call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They declared this fact to the powers and authorities in their world. And they described that coming wakeup call in colorful apocalyptic language. This is the biblical judgment day - the day when your bigotry and delusion finally catch up with you. Jesus described that event as having to experience "crying and anger", and the shame of being outcast - of feeling the deepest darkness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where did that put Jesus' followers?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on the writings we have, they lived in hope of vindication. In that confidence, they faced death and persecution, knowing that their efforts would ultimately pay off, that in the end, their cause would triumph.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They did not look beyond the horizon of their vindication. In fact, they described the coming experience of vindication as having the tears wiped from their eyes, as having no more sorrow or pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We need to understand those statements in context. There is a definite sense in which these things become true at a spiritual level. But there is more. In the Jewish scriptures, these same terms were used to describe things like the return of prisoners from captivity. You can imagine why - the relief of becoming free from slavery would be a drastic release from suffering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's important to realize that this is not an absolute release. After freedom, ex-slaves still experience suffering and tears. But they have moved to a new life, a new level of existence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same is true of the first Jesus-followers. Though they didn't look beyond the end of the first century, they did recognize that even after their vindication, there would be work to be done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The end of the book of Revelation is a highly poetic description of what their vindication would look like. The old Jerusalem is tragically burning, but a "new" Jerusalem is descending from heaven to earth. This Jerusalem is identified as the group of Jesus-followers, and in them, the presence of God has been brought more fully.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this picture, though grand, is no utopia. There are still opponents outside. And there is still work to be done. From the center of this metaphorical city, a river of life flows outward, watering the rest of the world. Trees in the city produce leaves that are healing the nations. The outside world has neither been fully dealt with, nor is it being ignored, nor is it being written off. Instead, the process of healing and growth continues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It would be a mistake to see progress and growth as all done with. It would also be a mistake to try to re-create the struggle that these people went through. Their struggle has been completed, and we will not engage in the same conflict again. Instead, we have our own obstacles to overcome, and our own change to create.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the picture of Revelation, the city has been established, and begins its work of healing the world. The gates are open, inviting everyone in. And as they come in, the city grows and becomes more glorious, on and on and on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The book of Daniel has a similar image. In it, a rock begins rolling, picking up speed until it smashes the forces of violence and oppression in the world. That rock becomes a mountain, and grows until it fills the whole earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our effort is neither done, nor will it be completely done in the future. Instead, after victory comes growth, and then more victory and growth forever. Our efforts achieve real and lasting results, and we build upon those results as we ascend upward and outward into an ever more glorious future.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2004/11/24/leprechaun-buttons-arrive/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2004/11/24/leprechaun-buttons-arrive/</link><pubDate>Wed Nov 24 10:46:00 CST 2004</pubDate><title>Leprechaun Buttons Arrive!</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>After a long and anguished wait, the "I Found A Leprechaun" Buttons have ARRIVED!

Okay, so continuing my thoughts on the [Simulation Argument](http://micahredding.com/blog/2011/11/23/int...</description><content:encoded>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As a disclaimer, this is a thought experiment, not an attempt at a scientific argument.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Okay, so continuing my thoughts on the &lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/2011/11/23/introduction-simulation-argument"&gt;Simulation Argument&lt;/a&gt;, I'd like to throw in some possible additions to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="blockinset" markdown="1"&gt;
###The _More Powerful Being_ Argument
1. If more powerful beings create more simulations
2. And less powerful beings create fewer simulations
3. Then we are probably in a simulation created by a more powerful being.
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hole in this argument is that it is possible for a "long-tail" to be in effect, where the mass of less powerful beings create more simulations &lt;em&gt;in total&lt;/em&gt; than the total number of simulations created by the more powerful beings. Someone better equipped mathematically will have to help me out here. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But I think that this argument would still hold under either of the following conditions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="blockinset" markdown="1"&gt;

A. If the power distribution follows an exponential curve, where the last being in the sequence would be more powerful than all the other beings combined.  

B. If the power distribution follows the  [Pareto principle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle), and 20% of the beings hold 80% of the power.  

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If an entity's ability to create simulations advances with technological progress, and if Moore's Law continues to hold, then we'd have condition A. If resources are allocated according to prevailing standards, and that continues to hold indefinitely, then we'd have condition B.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can take this further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="blockinset" markdown="1"&gt;
###The End of Time Argument
1. If the number of simulations increases exponentially over time
2. Then we are probably in a simulation created very near the end of time.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="blockinset" markdown="1"&gt;
###The _Most Powerful Being_ Argument
1. If the most powerful being creates more simulations than every other being *combined*
2. Then we are probably in a simulation created by the most powerful being.
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;These both, of course, are operating on the basis of condition A.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And finally,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="blockinset" markdown="1"&gt;
### The Infinite Being Argument
1. If there exists a being (or beings) who creates an infinite number of simulations
2. Then we are probably in a simulation created by an infinite being.
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Could such a being exist? I have no idea. I have no idea how we would establish that, other than looking at the broad scope of the multiverse, and suggesting that it might be possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But these arguments as a whole seem suggestive to me, indicating that if we are in a simulation, it is probably one created by an extremely powerful being near the end of time. And that would explain why we don't keep getting "Out Of Memory" errors.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/04/28/image-god/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/04/28/image-god/</link><pubDate>Sat Apr 28 12:38:05 CDT 2012</pubDate><title>The Image of God</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>In 1000 BC, in a world of slaves and warlords, where life was often *nasty, brutish, and short*, it would have been hard to imagine that humanity could ever be anything else.

The rule of violent warlords would extend forever, slavery would never end. Whatever situation you were born into, that would be the situation when you died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this world, it would make sense to write a mythology in which you were created as a subservient creature, made for slavery, locked into your fate by the gods themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is exactly what the Babylonians &lt;a href="http://www.cresourcei.org/enumaelish.html"&gt;did&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I will take blood and fashion bone.&lt;br/&gt;I will establish a savage, ‘man’ shall be his name.&lt;br/&gt;truly, savage-man I will create.&lt;br/&gt;He shall be charged with the service of the gods&lt;br/&gt;That they might be at ease! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;But for some inexplicable reason, the Jews wrote something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then God said, “Let us make man in our image, after our likeness” …&lt;br/&gt;So God created man in his own image,&lt;br/&gt;in the image of God he created him;&lt;br/&gt;male and female he created them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you lived in that world, why would think such a thing? Why would you dream that you were like the gods, that you had that kind of potential?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the Jews did dream. The Jews, against all reason, claimed that humanity was capable of far more than they had ever experienced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="http://www.joshuagraves.com/"&gt;friend of mine&lt;/a&gt; has compared the Genesis account to a song - the kind of song that after a lifetime in prison, would fill your heart with hope, telling you of a world beyond the walls and bars of your reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Against all hope, they sang of hope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And we have found them right. We have discovered worlds beyond the wildest imaginings of anyone living in their time. We have found human nature capable of things they could never have dreamed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the long and checkered history since that time, we have created brilliant works of art, we have probed the mysteries of creation, we have descended to the depths of the oceans, and ascended to the skies. We have walked on the moon. We have out-raced sound. We have peered into the beginnings of time, and peeled back the layers of reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that's not all. We have built civilizations that are concerned about compassion at a level never before seen. We have made great sacrifices and seen beautiful acts of kindness. Great individuals have shone as lights of profound selflessness in the midst of prejudice and oppression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our lives are a reality that no human should have thought was possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the ancient Jews &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt;. They gave us that hope - that no matter what our current reality, something grander and more beautiful and more profound was possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that remains true today. We have only seen the beginning of what they knew we had in us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only question is: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;how did they see it?&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2010/04/12/jesus-triumph-and-coronation/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2010/04/12/jesus-triumph-and-coronation/</link><pubDate>Mon Apr 12 23:58:22 CDT 2010</pubDate><title>Jesus' triumph and coronation</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>Biblically speaking, Jesus' triumph, his victory over the forces mounted against him, and the completion of his own internal struggle, was on the cross.

Dying, he conquered. His crucifixion was his exaltation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jesus made it clear that triumphing through letting go was not just something he was doing, but something all of his followers would do as well. "Whoever wants to be my student must take up his cross..."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Jesus' personal triumph was on the cross, where would we find his Messianic triumph? Where would we find him establishing his position over his kingdom?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jesus' followers asked him exactly this question. "When will these things be, and what will the sign of your appearing?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is usually taken to be a question about end-of-the-world issues. But they are really asking when Jesus will be shown (will appear) as the king over Israel. And his answer is as paradoxical as his life and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Jesus, he would be the king of Israel when Israel bit the dust. When the walls fell, when the temple was shattered, THEN Jesus would rule from the throne. &lt;em&gt;Because&lt;/em&gt;...only then would Israel and Jesus finally be united in the same fate. Only then would they both have been stripped of physical attachments. Only then would they have both become the victim of violent forces. Only then would they both experience the opportunity to be reborn as something newer and better and more eternal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By uniting with him in the likeness of his death, they would have the opportunity to experience newness in the likeness of his resurrection.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/miracles-vs-magic/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/miracles-vs-magic/</link><pubDate>Tue Dec 04 13:07:45 CST 2018</pubDate><title>Miracles vs Magic</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>In 1600, during Giordano Bruno's heresy trial, the inquisitors asked a question: *Did he believe Jesus' miracles were performed by magic?*

In our post-Enlightenment world, this seems like a distinction without a difference, bordering on the absurd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And yet this miracle / magic distinction runs quite deep. Sociologists suggest that this division is a distinctive aspect of monotheism. So what does it mean, and how does it connect to our world today?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Jesus on Miracles&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Christianity, &lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/christianity-is-love"&gt;everything is relational&lt;/a&gt;. So in the Gospels, the distinction between miracles and magic is that miracles are manifestations of legitimate pro-social authority, while magic is a manifestation of anti-social control. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Jesus heals people, for example, he often tells them that they have healed themselves. “Your faith has made you well.” But in turn, he asserts that “My sheep hear my voice”. In other words, Jesus is not healing by exercising control over the people who come to him. Rather, he is commanding them to be healed, and in recognition of his spiritual authority, they are obediently healing themselves. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This response validates Jesus' claims to spiritual authority. The community is responding to Jesus' call for healing, affirming his authority in the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've argued elsewhere that &lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/wireheading-faith-healing-and-the-placebo-effect"&gt;this is how the placebo effect operates&lt;/a&gt;. The placebo effect is the most documented phenomenon in medical history, and contrary to popular interpretation, it points to the pervasive ability of people to heal themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We needn't make any assumptions about how this works. Materialistically, spiritually, or some combination of the two—the phenomenon is the same. People have a widely documented capacity for self-healing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why, then, don't people just spontaneously heal themselves as soon as symptoms start to manifest? Why wait until someone gives them a placebo? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My argument is that this self-healing ability is fundamentally dangerous. Just as pharmacists don't dispense narcotics without a prescription, your brain requires external authorization in order to engage its most extreme functions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For your own protection, you cannot invoke your own abilities without permission from a legitimate authority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If this is true, it means that at a deep level, your brain possesses the ability to recognize legitimate, pro-social sources of authority. And it means that this system &lt;em&gt;necessarily supercedes the conscious, volitional mind&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your brain can recognize legitimate authority, whether you realize it or not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a Doctor, Priest, or Rabbi blesses you and tells you to get well, this internal system may recognize the presence of a legitimate pro-social authority, and unlock various mental and physical resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like everything else, this system will be imperfect. But given its importance, it's also likely to be one of the more robust systems in the human brain. This system likely grants varying levels of access, to varying kinds of abilities, depending on the nature of the authority. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means that &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;healings are evidence of legitimate pro-social authority&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is what the Gospels suggest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Gospels continually present Jesus’ widespread, phenomenal healings as evidence of Jesus’ spiritual authority. Jesus always claims to be operating on the spiritual authority of God, as validated &lt;em&gt;through&lt;/em&gt; the community, &lt;em&gt;by&lt;/em&gt; the healings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s the biblical understanding of a miracle. So what is magic?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Jesus on Trial for Magic&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the earliest times, skeptics have claimed that Jesus’ miracles were done by magic. In fact, this claim shows up in the Gospels themselves—as his opponents assert that Jesus healed people through the power of demons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's important to understand the distinction here. To claim that these healings were &lt;em&gt;magic&lt;/em&gt; was to claim that Jesus wasn’t legitimately recognized by the community, but was instead entering into a pact with spiritual forces which were opposed to the community. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If that’s what Jesus was doing, then the healings weren’t evidence of spiritual authority at all, but were evidence of having claimed spiritual authority on false pretenses. Further, they were evidence that Jesus was using these healings to undermine the community’s very existence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So this was a very significant charge. Jesus answers this charge in two slightly different ways. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, &lt;strong&gt;How can an anti-social force do pro-social things?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the community is being healed, set right, and made well, how can that be a force working against the community? With enemies like these—who needs friends! More to the point, if this was a destructive force, it was the most ineffective one in history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If by the Prince of Demons, I cast out demons, how can his kingdom stand?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, &lt;strong&gt;If you reject this evidence of spiritual authority, what further evidence is left?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is Jesus’ infamous “unpardonable sin” passage. Jesus tells his opponents that it is understandable to have doubted God (who you cannot see), or himself (who was unexpected). But if you look at the only evidence that could be provided, and choose to dismiss it—what else is left?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What further proof could you find? What else could God or the community do? What could possibly keep you from sliding into nihilism?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you interpret the &lt;em&gt;flourishing of the community&lt;/em&gt; as a sign of the &lt;em&gt;destruction of the community&lt;/em&gt;, then what kind of flourishing have you left open to yourself?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Key to the Case&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;So this is the question: Does Jesus heal by miracles, or by magic? Does Jesus heal by the pro-social, emergent recognition of his spiritual authority within the community—or by the anti-social exercise of illegitimate control?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Key to the case is something that we tend to ignore, but the Gospels go out of their way to point out: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jesus couldn’t heal everyone.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were particular places, such as his own hometown, where Jesus was not able to heal people. The Gospels explain that this was because they were not receptive to his spiritual authority. In other words, having dismissed him as a mere carpenter’s son, Jesus’ power was nullified. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many Christians, this is a point of embarrassment. How could the power of the Son of God fail? But for the Gospels, &lt;em&gt;this is key.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Jesus was exercising illegitimate control, cooperating with an anti-community force, he could coerce anyone and everyone to be healed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if Jesus was &lt;em&gt;authorizing&lt;/em&gt; people to be healed, and their deepest selves were freely responding to his command, then it was a true recognition of pro-social authority. It validated the fact that God—the ultimate pro-social force—was really at work. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it meant that sometimes, &lt;em&gt;Jesus’ healings had to fail&lt;/em&gt;. God does not coerce anyone’s allegiance, and so the Son of God cannot coerce anyone’s self-healing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s important to note that the Gospels don’t stop with the physical healings. Jesus goes on from healing people, to feeding crowds, to walking across water and calming a storm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the Gospels present all of these as the exercise of authority. Jesus commands the storm to be still, and it does. The Son of Man has authority even over the Sea. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This authority is remarkable precisely because it is not coercive power. In the worldview of the Gospels, we must conclude that the Sea had some measure of choice. Like a skilled horse-whisperer with an anxious animal, Jesus tells the Sea to be calm, and it responds in recognition of someone who can be trusted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So these are the possibilities. One—that Jesus worked through the exercise of pro-social, legitimate and cooperative authority. Another—that Jesus worked through the exercise of anti-social, illegitimate control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These possibilities have been debated since the earliest times. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this is the difference between miracles and magic.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2013/01/01/problem-evil-problem-humanity/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2013/01/01/problem-evil-problem-humanity/</link><pubDate>Tue Jan 01 17:32:19 CST 2013</pubDate><title>The Problem of Evil is the Problem of Humanity</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>The Problem of Evil contrasts three ideas:

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Evil, suffering, and pain exist.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We believe that God is all powerful.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We believe that God is completely benevolent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;For our purposes, let’s define “all powerful” as “having the ability to create any possible world”. Christians and other theists don’t necessarily assert that God actually &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; that power (these sorts of discussions are never brought up in the Jewish or Christian scriptures, for example), but I think we can say that this is the &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; power that any reasonably conceived God could have. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people would understand “all powerful” to mean the ability to intervene in our world. But for our purposes, we can say that for God to intervene is the same as creating a logically distinct world. For example, if God was to intervene to prevent a particular murder, this would be the same as having created a universe in which that particular murder was never a possibility. Or, more obviously, if God was to intervene to set the entire world to rights, that would be the same as destroying this world, and creating a new world in its place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, rephrased:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This world has evil, suffering, and pain.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We believe that God could have created any possible world.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We believe that God is completely benevolent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the focus of this argument is on living beings who suffer. Worlds which do not contain living beings are irrelevant. So,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This world has evil, suffering, and pain.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We believe that God could have created living beings in any possible world.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We believe that God is completely benevolent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, the fact that God could have created beings in other worlds is a logically distinct issue from the fact that he created beings in this one. Since there is no reason to presume that creating one world prevents creating another, we can reason that these are distinct and independent decisions on God’s part. He may have created another world with very little suffering, for example, but that doesn’t say anything about his choice to create this one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To see that this is so, consider someone building houses. When we buy a house, we typically only buy one, and so we compare and contrast, determining which one we prefer. But the house builder will build hundreds of houses in his career, and so determines which houses to build based on their own intrinsic merits. Just because he may decide that a three-story house is better than a ranch-style house, this does not mean that he won’t build a ranch-style house on a particular piece of property. He may choose to do so or not, but that is an independent question from whether or not he builds a three-story house in the city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, given that fact, we can rephrase the argument again:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This world has evil, suffering, and pain.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We believe that God had the choice to create living beings in this world, or not.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We believe that God’s choice was benevolent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;This argument can now be understood in a way much more relevant to the choices we human beings face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This world has evil, suffering, and pain.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;God had the choice to bring beings into it, or not.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We believe that God’s choice was benevolent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;When seen this way, God’s choice and our choice is the same: whether or not to bring beings into this particular, suffering-prone world. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;God made the decision to do so.&lt;br/&gt;Our ancestors made the decision to do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are only here because of that choice. To the extent that we uphold the choices of our ancestors, we defend the choices of God. To the extent that we make the choice to invest in the continuing existence of the human species, we are justifying God as benevolent. To the extent that we reject God as benevolent, we reject the human enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/02/24/non-metaphysical-christianity/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/02/24/non-metaphysical-christianity/</link><pubDate>Fri Feb 24 11:53:17 CST 2012</pubDate><title>Non-Metaphysical Christianity</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>The understanding of Christianity and the scriptures as speaking directly to experienced realities, rather than trying to map metaphysical existence.

People are strolling towards the Miller's house.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Millers are a lower-level wealthy family, so their house is nice and big, and standing in their courtyard as the sun sets, when a cooling breeze kicks up, is one of the most wonderful experiences anyone in town could have. Inside, the wine is being poured, and the guests are beginning to arrive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the outside, it could be any rich person's party, except for the guest-list. Instead of rich friends and bureaucrats, this party includes a large number of poor people, ethnic Jews, and even slaves. That fact strikes the neighbors as scandalous, and has the neighborhood talking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the poorer Jews begin to arrive, they see the party in full swing. A lot of the wealthier, non-Jewish, guests arrived earlier, not chafing under the restrictions on Sabbath day travel. And a lot of them have imbibed too much wine already.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pretty soon, people are drinking and showing off their new abilities. Some begin shouting over others, laughingly clamoring for attention. Others are boasting about how rich they are. Some of the husbands and wives are loudly arguing with each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is to this scenario that Paul writes his letters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Written the night before 5 April 2010, 7:09am. -Micah&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2005/08/26/writers-showcase-lineup/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2005/08/26/writers-showcase-lineup/</link><pubDate>Fri Aug 26 11:56:00 CDT 2005</pubDate><title>Writers Showcase Lineup</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>Brian White is a staff writer for BMG / Brentwood Benson.

Her lyrics tear you apart line by line, only to build you back again with verse after verse of surgically precise digs and strokes. Raymond casually combines elements of soul and folk into something she playfully refers to as "soulk music" (which, afterall, sounds better than "foul music"). Whatever she calls it, it's not your average girl-with-a-guitar fare and deserves your undivided ear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.myspace.com/shelleyraymond"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.myspace.com/shelleyraymond"&gt;http://www.myspace.com/shelleyraymond&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gentry Morris&lt;/strong&gt;: Ok so here is my bio...I am a pretty ordinary guy by most accounts. I grew up in Georgia listening to my dads old Creedance Clearwater Revival and James Taylor records and until I was about 13 I had absolutely no idea that there was any other music besides this...yes...I was sheltered. When I started playing guitar it was because I was a skinny little white kid and the girls didn't like me...football was out...so i figured...maybe if I played guitar. Yeah...no artsy, I wanna change the way things work reasons...it was all for the chicks. Really that's what it comes down to for most musicians whether they want to admit it or not. Well the girls still didn't like me...sad day...so I started writing songs about it and then it began...no...no...no...not the girls liking me...the songwriting thing. So here I am today living in Nashville Tennessee trying to convince people to listen to my music and give me money for CD's. My music is a "montage" (my word of the day) of those old classics my dad had, mixed with some more recent influences. People say I sound like John Mayer and Jason Mraz alot...I dont really see it that much but its cool if they do. Another one of my friends said I sound like an American version of Travis...which is really cool cause those guys rock! Anyway...I like my music...its not meant to be artsy or techincally difficult with secret meanings and all that jazz. It is meant to be simple... catchy...songs that will get stuck in your head...songs for first dates or last dates...songs for sunny days lying on your back in a park or rainy days driving in your car...they are singing in the shower songs...thats what I do...I make the songs you sing in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.gentrymorris.com/"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.gentrymorris.com/"&gt;http://www.gentrymorris.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mayflye&lt;/strong&gt; are an acoustic rock quartet based in Murfreesboro, TN. Comprised of four regular guys with day jobs and cell-phone bills, Mayflye spend their free time writing melodic rock songs with a verve that is often unseen in the contemporary acoustic genre today. Initially founded by fellow MTSU alumni, Gregory Castillo, Matt Frasher, and John Sorrels began writing songs together on the bottom floor of a poorly ventilated Murfreesboro apartment complex in early 2004. Later that spring and in need of a bassist, they joined forces with perhaps the most unlikely of characters, David Castro, a Columbian refugee with little to no experience as a bass player. In a brilliant display of confidence, David picked up the bass and earned his way into the band, dazzling its members with his obvious knack for melody and rhythmic poise. Since then, Mayflye have been determined to further their abilities and broaden their musical tact by flirting with a variety of new styles and even new instruments. So, is it possible that you will see a Mayflye post-hardcore polka-funk album in the near future? You never know. You just might.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.myspace.com/mayflye"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.myspace.com/mayflye"&gt;http://www.myspace.com/mayflye&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2005/02/11/new-tourdate-system/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2005/02/11/new-tourdate-system/</link><pubDate>Fri Feb 11 19:00:00 CST 2005</pubDate><title>New Tourdate System</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>Ooooh...the excitement.

Here, somebody had gone through Christianity, and packaged its most essential concepts for the secular world. [^1]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I soon discovered that other people did not see this the way I did. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same thing happened when I discovered transhumanism. In transhumanism, I found the full expression of what my Christianity meant to me. So I was astounded to discover that many transhumanists were not only non-religious, but considered transhumanism and Christianity to be antithetical. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Humanists often see things in the same way. One person told me that humanism was the bastard stepchild of Christianity, and that the two hadn't been on speaking terms since humanism left home. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think there is a better way to frame this, both historically and sociologically. I suspect that all cultures and worldviews must periodically send off expeditions to explore specific ideas, in ways the mother culture is unable to. If the expedition is successful, the explorers will return with tales of vast uncultivated ground, and maps of how to get there. And then mainstream society will begin to colonize this new territory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is what happened in our history. Christian Europe sent off an expedition to explore the ideas of humanism. The result was the discovery of new worlds, new ways of acting and forming society. In the last centuries, this ground has been colonized by mainstream society, and many of us now live in liberal secular democracies fueled by world-wide capitalism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now humanism has sent off its own expedition, pursuing the ideas of transhumanism. And I think it's time for this expedition to return home, and tell the mother culture what we’ve found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the first wave of returning explorers is often so affected by their discoveries that they are unrecognizable to their mother culture. They have seen things and had experiences that the mainstream cannot relate to, and they often speak in a language that is rough and frightening. Sometimes they are so foreign, they are never accepted back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first religious explorers of transhumanism often related to their faith very differently than the mainstream world. So when they began to engage in the process of translation, they started by lining up sets of religious and transhumanist ideas, trying to connect the dots. By finding superficial similarities, they were able to cobble together somewhat interesting translations. But the problem was that this translation didn't relate well to either side — because it misunderstood both at a fundamental level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, it is possible to take the account of Elijah’s ascension to heaven, and see something superficially similar to space flight. Erich Von Daniken made exactly this connection, arguing that these sorts of biblical stories match very well with a description of vertical lift-off. [^2]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But though some religious people view this account as literal, and others view it as metaphorical, few believe that the primary significance of this account has to do with lift-off. That translation misconstrues both the modern impulse towards space exploration, and the ancient meaning of a great prophet's ascension.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A better place to start is the beginning of the Hebrew Bible. The Jewish scriptures came into existence in a world which saw everything as part of the great wheel of time, the eternal return, everything repeating like the seasons. In this world, there was no individual significance, no personal value, no chance of accomplishing anything, because time was simply on repeat, and nothing could ever change. [^3]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This world was full of creation myths that looked a little like this: there were some gods, and they needed someone to do their menial tasks, so they created human beings to be their slaves. [^4]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jewish scripture is a revolt against this understanding. Right at the beginning, in Genesis 1, we have one of the most significant statements ever made:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;So God created man in his own image...male and female...and said to them, “Be fruitful and increase in number; fill the earth and subdue it.” [^5]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Human beings were not slaves, but were embodiments of the divine. Humans reflected something deep and significant about reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next chapters describe God planting a garden, placing man inside, and giving him the task of cultivating it. This was not to be the eternal home of mankind. Outside was a wild, untamed world, and humanity had been placed within a cradle until they could learn how to cultivate and grow and create as God himself had done. [^6]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Humanity was intended to be creators, and God was training them to take on the task themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abraham is significant in just this way. He was called out of his country, with the intention of building a society he could not yet foresee. In a world where nothing ever changed, and things continued as they always had, Abraham ventured out to create something new, breaking the wheel of time, and writing his personal identity into the world. This is why he is called the “Father of Faith”, and is important to Jews, Christians, and Muslims. In a certain sense, history begins with him. [^7]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we arrive at the Christian scriptures, the story intensifies. In the same way that consciousness is not a rejection of life, but an intensification and return on the concept, the Christian scriptures see themselves as continuous with the Jewish scriptures, but intensified to an order of magnitude. [^8]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where the Jewish scriptures begin with humanity intended to bear the image of God, the Christian scriptures begin with a man who is bearing that image in all its fullness and completion, and who intends that image to take root and become embodied in all of humanity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means the radical redefinition of just what a human being is. In a world defined by political, social, religious, and racial boundaries, Jesus and his earliest followers are in some ways the first transhumanists, arguing for a human identity outside and beyond all of those things. This is why Paul says there is no “Jew or gentile, male or female, slave or free” — he is breaking the constraints on human identity along every dimension of the ancient world. [^9]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Jewish professor once explained to me that in a certain sense, Christianity was the world's first religion. It was the first group in history to create an axis of identity distinct from the circumstances of your birth. It was the first group to divorce geography from belief. [^10]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is exactly how the first Christians saw themselves. They were bringing into being a world which would no longer be defined by temples, kings, empires, and social strata. Without knowing what that looked like, they believed in that future. They saw that to be human was to be something dynamic and unconstrained, constantly creative, always requiring the moving of the boundaries, and the redefinition of things previously seen as constants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the proper starting point for engagement with the religious world at large — not far-fetched ideas about what we may become, or superficial similarities between Christian terms and transhumanist ideas, or “the rapture of the nerds”, or the singularity as second coming — but the recovery of the scriptures’ powerful and incendiary idea of what it means to be human.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hZSn0ojtlM"&gt;&amp;gt; Watch this talk &amp;lt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[^1]: By humanism, I am primarily referring to the streams of thought that emphasize rationalism, independent thought, and the elevation of the status of the individual. By transhumanism, I am using a universalized version of the definition cited by Wikipedia: “Transhumanism…affirms the possibility and desirability of fundamentally transforming the human condition…to greatly enhance human intellectual, physical, and psychological capacities” &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transhumanism"&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transhumanism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[^2]: Elijah’s ascent is described in 2 Kings 2:11. Erich Von Daniken begins drawing these sorts of comparisons in &lt;em&gt;Chariots of The Gods?&lt;/em&gt; See page 58 for a mention of Elijah, pages 37-39 for a similar interpretation of Ezekiel’s vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[^3]: In this section, I am largely relying on the work of Thomas Cahill in &lt;em&gt;The Gifts of The Jews&lt;/em&gt;.

A deeper background to my thought-process here is &lt;em&gt;The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of The Bicameral Mind&lt;/em&gt;, by Julian Jaynes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[^4]: See, for example, the Sumerian creation myth. &lt;a href="http://faculty.gvsu.edu/websterm/SumerianMyth.htm"&gt;http://faculty.gvsu.edu/websterm/SumerianMyth.htm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[^5]: Genesis 1:27-28, NIV. Some people misunderstand this passage to be a mandate to destroy the environment. See Daniel Quinn’s implied reading of Genesis 2: &lt;a href="http://www.ishmael.org/Vision/"&gt;http://www.ishmael.org/Vision/&lt;/a&gt;. But this is a modernist reading of the original text, not part of the original author’s intent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[^6]: Genesis 2:15 and context describe humanity as being given the task of cultivating the garden of Eden. Genesis 1:27-28 describes their larger purpose and task, which would eventually require moving beyond the garden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[^7]: For a glimpse of how Christianity interprets Abraham, consider Hebrews 11:8-12, and Romans 4:13-22.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[^8]: My reading of the New Testament is heavily influenced by the work of Andrew Perriman and N. T. Wright, modified by the anthropology of René Girard, and the systemic analysis of Walter Wink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[^9]: Paraphrase of Galatians 3:28, with an interpretation provided by Peter Rollins, &lt;em&gt;Insurrection&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[^10]: Amy-Jill Levine, private gathering&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2007/01/05/did-jesus-create-the-world-or-did-god/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2007/01/05/did-jesus-create-the-world-or-did-god/</link><pubDate>Fri Jan 05 03:00:00 CST 2007</pubDate><title>Did Jesus Create the World?

But, why does Genesis not mention this? That is what I always wondered, until just recently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You see, John 1 doesn't actually say that "Jesus" helped God create the world. It says "the word" did. "Word" is from the Greek "logos", which means "spoken word", "message", "thought", etc. Also note that the pronouns used here ("he","his",etc) are generic, and can just as easily mean "it" or "he".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After some consideration, here is my translation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the beginning was the spoken word (of God), and the spoken words came from God, and the spoken words were (part of) God. They were in the beginning with God. All things were made through them, and nothing exists without them. In them was life, and the life was the light of humans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the light shone in the darkness, and the darkness comprehended it not. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;...And the spoken word (of God) became flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld his glory, the glory as of a unique son of the father, full of grace and truth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forgive the clumsy and unfamiliar translation. I believe this conveys some of the essence of the passage, without mangling it too much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notice that this brings out the Genesis parallels very well. John is not contradicting Genesis, he is expanding upon it. God spoke the world into existence: "let there be light" and there was light. It was God's spoken words that were used to create the world, and it is "every word that proceeds from the mouth of God" which gives life and light to humanity. The word (the message) of God became flesh in the person of Jesus of Nazareth, an individual who fully embodied God's message to humanity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our simplistic traditional reading typically just substitutes "Jesus" for "Word", and gives Jesus the title "The Word" with no further thought. John's intent is deeper here. John is drawing out the concept of the powerful utterances of God which formed the world, which guide humanity, and which have now formed into a human individual through whom God utters his complete revelation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jesus, John says, is God's most complete utterance. John is not even addressing pre-existence here, as the most common applications would have it. John is addressing the role, power, and importance of Jesus; God's words were powerful when he spoke the worlds into existence, now God has spoken, and that speech is Jesus. Neglecting Jesus is neglecting God's voice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is interesting that the spoken words/message/thought/utterance of God is called "God". Typically, we just take this as a statement of Jesus' divinity. But that's reading the text backwards, from the bottom up. John intends his readers to work FORWARDS through the text. So he starts off reminding his readers of Genesis, and how God spoke in the beginning. The words went out from God, BUT (John interjects) the words WERE God.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How is this? What is John saying?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John is saying that the words of God are his very essence, that they convey his true nature. As such, God's words are simply extensions of himself. They convey his thought, his mind. Throughout the bible, we are impressed with the concept of the powerful words of God, words that are so powerful, they are alive. When God speaks, it is as if he is sending out his very spirit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then John reminds us that the words of God formed the worlds. All things were created through the spoken words of God, and nothing exists apart from them. And as Jesus pointed out, the words of God are the source of life both physical and spiritual for all humanity. The words of God are life and light to mankind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And though God has spoken into the darkness (both in sending his spiritual message to darkened humanity and in saying "let there be light" in the darkness of Genesis 1) the darkness of humanity has not comprehended his teachings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BUT NOW, John says, God's words have become flesh. God's words, the very essence of God, have become incarnate in Jesus of Nazareth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="technoratitag" style="display:none;"&gt;Technorati Tags:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/eschatology" target="_blank" rel="tag" title="Link to Technorati Tag category for eschatology"&gt;eschatology&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/theology" target="_blank" rel="tag" title="Link to Technorati Tag category for theology"&gt;theology&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/religion" target="_blank" rel="tag" title="Link to Technorati Tag category for religion"&gt;religion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/spirituality" target="_blank" rel="tag" title="Link to Technorati Tag category for spirituality"&gt;spirituality&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/jesus" target="_blank" rel="tag" title="Link to Technorati Tag category for jesus"&gt;jesus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/christ" target="_blank" rel="tag" title="Link to Technorati Tag category for christ"&gt;christ&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/god" target="_blank" rel="tag" title="Link to Technorati Tag category for god"&gt;god&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2010/01/18/converge/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2010/01/18/converge/</link><pubDate>Mon Jan 18 13:49:33 CST 2010</pubDate><title>converge</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>Ever since I was 15, I've identified myself primarily as a songwriter.

It is what I do, and who I am.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And ever since I began performing, I've begun segmenting myself. There is the side of me that performs and travels, and does ridiculous things in random midwestern states. There is the side of me that is introspective, that writes about the things I see, and tries to see the world differently. And there is the side of me that is all logic and precision and theology and politics and economics all blended together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it's always a difficult thing to decide how much of each one I should share with the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a musician, I'm expected to do things. Play big concerts, tour around the world, meet famous people, and maybe even cause a few international incidents along the way. Since I'm also a musician who writes songs, I'm perhaps expected to see things a little differently. But I don't really think there's any true cultural precedent for a musician who thinks critically about things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This makes sense. We don't turn to Bill O'Reilly to find music that stirs our souls, and we don't turn to Fergie to learn about international politics. By and large, we want our public figures segmented into careful categories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But I don't think I'm really able to segment myself like that anymore. For me, thinking bold and interesting new thoughts, analyzing the political and religious and cultural messages I hear, having new insights about the world, writing music, and performing for others, all came meshed together. There is some kind of organic symbiotic relationship between all these aspects of my life. And every time I've tried to carefully box each segment up, they begin bleeding together, overrunning their barriers, and meeting in a confusing mess on the floor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My main resolution this year is to do nothing I'm not passionate about. I think that means taking down some of the walls I've built. I think it means letting things converge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I believe in convergence. Progress in technology is almost always about the convergence of previously unrelated things; lately, many people's phones have become their computers. Blending styles has always been the way music has progressed; despite radio's failures, we are the heirs of a broad and rich spectrum of musical influences, stretching back through centuries. The convergence of different ethnicities helped to make America great, and the convergence of science, art, philosophy, and religion sparked what came to be known as the Renaissance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Convergence isn't just a way to kick off new creative movements. It's also the reality of humankind. We live in a rapidly converging world, where the actions of tribal people in remote parts of the earth deeply impact the lives of urban citizens in first-world countries. In the past, many would disregard the needs of strangers, expecting never to see those people again. Now, it is increasingly likely that the people who are strangers today will encounter you again and again, as neighbors, coworkers, or people you meet online. For humanity, all of our individual paths are converging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is something deep about reality, I think, that works to take all of its far-flung pieces, and bring them back together. Even as we diverge and diversify, our worlds collide. Even as the universe spreads outward, it becomes more interconnected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I am going to try to stop fighting. I'm going to try to let go of my struggle against gravity, and let all the pieces of my life turn and plummet back together. And we'll see what happens.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2008/09/02/beyond-polarization/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2008/09/02/beyond-polarization/</link><pubDate>Tue Sep 02 11:48:00 CDT 2008</pubDate><title>Beyond Polarization</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>People often say, "God is not a democrat or republican".

This is a welcome change from a few years ago, when people often claimed that a Christian could only vote for a particular political party, or face the wrath of God.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it is not enough. That statement does not adequately deal with the depth of feeling on each side of the issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conservatives, for example, feel that liberal policies are blatantly immoral. They steal from one group to distribute to another, they advocate the death of children, etc. Opposition to the "liberals", then, is not just a political preference, but a deeply held ethical belief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, liberals protest that conservatives have gutted the gospel. Jesus' statements about the poor are ignored by conservatives in favor of their wealthy constituents. Opposition to the "conservatives", then, is an attempt to deliver divine justice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both are right and wrong in this. Liberals bring the realization that law does not equal ethics; whether to outlaw abortion is a different ethical question than whether abortion is good. This is something the conservatives have yet to realize. Conservatives bring the realization that the "means" are just as important as the "ends"; that every means of helping the poor is not equally right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a lot that each needs to learn from the other, as old party lines are transcended, and new social and political realities begin to form.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What insights can &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;you&lt;/span&gt; bring from your traditions?&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2010/05/01/two-thoughts-i-posted-to-twitter/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2010/05/01/two-thoughts-i-posted-to-twitter/</link><pubDate>Sat May 01 00:02:40 CDT 2010</pubDate><title>Two thoughts I posted to Twitter</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>These are two things I wrote on Twitter earlier today.

Thought I would archive them here as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I'm a conservative in this respect:&lt;/strong&gt; I think the scriptures give us an inside look at a moment in history when something new and amazing burst into existence. A flawed community composing a scandalous integration of rich and poor, slaves and slave-holders, and men and women from every ethnicity...all together, mingling as equals. This moment remains one of the most significant moments in history, and compels us to continually reach back for a better glimpse at what they saw...so that we might see the same thing, and transformation may burst into our world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The scriptures are difficult&lt;/strong&gt;, because we are not looking at some Platonic book of doctrines or commands, dropped from heaven to earth - but are looking at a gritty, real-world account of the struggles these radical communities were going through in trying to manage the monumental clash of all ends of the human spectrum, brought together at once. Whatever the scriptures are NOT, it remains that they ARE one of the most profound resources humanity has ever produced.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2010/10/31/philosophy-of-information/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2010/10/31/philosophy-of-information/</link><pubDate>Sun Oct 31 01:06:57 CDT 2010</pubDate><title>Philosophy of information</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>Going forward, the world will be increasingly centered around information.

And so it is necessary to understand a few things about information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1) Information has no location. At a fundamental level, information just IS. It can be instantiated at a certain place and time (I write down the number 3 on a sheet of paper), but it is fundamentally placeless (the existence of 3 has nothing to do with whether I write it down or not).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2) It is more proper to talk about instances of information than it is to talk about copies. Since information is placeless, there is no "original" and no "copy". Rather, information may exist (may have instances) in various locations at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3) Since there are no originals and no copies, multiple instances of information are not really different things, they are one thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4) The more similar two pieces of information are to each other, the "closer" they are in the only way that matters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;5) As soon as two instances of a piece of information begin to diverge, they are no longer the same thing. Now they are getting farther away from each other in the only way that matters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;6) Conversely, if two different pieces of information become more and more similar until they are identical, they have moved closer and closer until becoming one thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;7) The best way to describe these kinds of motions might be "possibility space". Possibility space is a way of talking about how different different pieces of information are. Similar pieces of information are close, dissimilar pieces are far away. Identical pieces of information occupy the same location in possibility space, which is why they are considered identical.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/christian-transhumanism-is-the-next-reformation/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/christian-transhumanism-is-the-next-reformation/</link><pubDate>Tue Oct 17 20:56:20 CDT 2017</pubDate><title>Christian Transhumanism is the Next Reformation</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>*[Published at the Huffington Post](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/59e40d37e4b09e31db975a6c)*

With the printing press, the public had incredible access to the scriptures, and diverse religious views could be widely disseminated. Suddenly, anyone could challenge ecclesiastical authority with their own interpretations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The written word had replaced the church as the arbiter of truth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This new source of authority meant that literacy was no longer a luxury for the wealthy and educated, but a religious imperative. Reading and interpreting scripture for oneself became a core part of religious practice, and teaching people to read became part of the mission of the church.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This wasn’t the first time social and technological change had caused upheaval in Christianity. According to Phyllis Tickle, author of the ground-breaking work “&lt;a href="http://amzn.to/2wXOudE"&gt;The Great Emergence&lt;/a&gt;”, this is something that happens every 500 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every 500 years, Christianity reboots. Or as Tickle would put it: Christianity goes into its attic, pulls everything out, and has a massive rummage sale. Every time this happens, Christianity emerges stronger than before—lighter, faster, cleaner. Rather than losing steam, it speeds up, becomes more resilient, more intense, more compelling. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What always emerges is a profoundly new form of Christianity, which proceeds to spread across vast new areas of geographic and demographic space—with radical implications for politics, science, industry, social structure, and technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It saw the rise of the nation-state, it was the rise of the middle class…it also brought capitalism” Tickle says, describing the impact of the Protestant Reformation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, Phyllis Tickle is not the first person to suggest that Christianity goes through this kind of reinvention. G. K. Chesterton, a Catholic writer, suggested the same thing in 1925. Chesterton argued that this reinvention isn’t something foreign to Christianity, but is an intrinsic and natural part of a religion whose main theme is death and resurrection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Christendom has had a series of revolutions and in each one of them Christianity has died. Christianity has died many times and risen again; for it had a God who knew the way out of the grave.” - GK Chesterton&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, as Chesterton sees it, it is exactly this ability to die and emerge as a new religion that makes Christianity so resilient. Every time it dies, it becomes stronger. Every time it dies, it gains ground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Tickle, we should expect one of these upheavals and rebirths every 500 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which means that we are due for a New Reformation right now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tickle argued that this is exactly what we are experiencing. From a certain religious perspective, everything seems to be falling apart. But from another perspective, we’re witnessing incredible new possibilities emerge—and some of these possibilities may lead past the downfall of Christianity, to its rebirth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;50 years ago, Julian Huxley announced a new philosophy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The human species can, if it wishes, transcend itself—not just sporadically…but in its entirety, as humanity. We need a name for this new belief. Perhaps *transhumanism* will serve: man remaining man, but trans­cending himself, by realizing new possibilities of and for his human nature.” — Julian Huxley&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Huxley was deeply influenced by his friend, the Jesuit priest and paleontologist Teilhard de Chardin. Teilhard spent his life working to reconcile science and religion, in the process coming to profound insights about the nature of the world and human life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Huxley was deeply secular, his vision was in many ways an attempt to capture what he saw in Teilhard’s work. From the very beginning, &lt;em&gt;transhumanism&lt;/em&gt;—though expressed in a secular context, for secular individuals—was an essentially religious vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;5 years ago, I started writing about &lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/04/25/christianity-transhumanism"&gt;Christian Transhumanism&lt;/a&gt;, the attempt to reconnect the transhumanist vision with its religious roots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phyllis Tickle says that there is one question every Reformation must answer: &lt;em&gt;What is the authority?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1500 years ago, it was the creeds of the ecumenical councils.&lt;br/&gt;1000 years ago, it was the Pope.&lt;br/&gt;500 years ago, it was the Bible.&lt;br/&gt;Now, it is TBD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But I think that Christian Transhumanism offers a possible answer. The authority is in &lt;em&gt;the future itself&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That, after all, is &lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/2016/02/04/faith-of-the-martian"&gt;what faith is about&lt;/a&gt;: embracing God’s vision of the future, and pursuing it despite fear and danger. In the Christian faith, the future is where God’s will is done “on earth as it is in heaven”—where heaven descends to earth, the cosmos is renewed, and God and humanity are reunited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Embracing that future casts a profound light on our present, changing our perspective on everything from the Problem of Evil to the nature of human life. It provokes us to challenge ourselves and our society, it calls us to a higher ethic and mission, it places us in a larger story with incredible meaning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a way that’s never been possible before, cutting-edge science and technology are allowing us to catch a glimpse of what that future might look like. Not completely, not fully—but in fits and starts, in vague forms and intimations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study of A.I. causes us to consider beings more powerful than we are. The construction of Virtual Reality provokes us to reflect on the creation of our world. The exploration of space allows us to contemplate our God-given reach. &lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/2016/02/17/why-christians-should-support-radical-life-extension"&gt;Radical longevity&lt;/a&gt; confronts us with questions about what life on earth is &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many secular people, that glimpse is—shockingly, surprisingly—opening the door to religion. For many Christians, it’s casting new light on the &lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/partnership-with-god"&gt;story of scripture&lt;/a&gt;. For many believers, it’s provoking exciting new expressions of faith.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;500 years after Martin Luther, new technologies and new questions are once again disrupting the most widespread expressions of religion. We’re looking for a way to move forward, and we know that Christianity must arise stronger and more dynamic than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it does, it will challenge our notions of humanity and society at a level never before seen.

We played on Friday at &lt;a href="http://www.commongroundsoflexington.com/"&gt;Common Grounds&lt;/a&gt; in Lexington, and the show went MUCH better than our last show there during which all of our equipment fried. We spent the night there in Georgetown (suburb of Lexington), and then headed up to Dayton in the morning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After hanging around Dayton all day looking at guitar and computer stores, trying to find a free coffee-maker, and otherwise wandering all over the city, we ended the night playing with &lt;a href="http://www.purevolume.com/tornfromred"&gt;Torn From Red&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.purevolume.com/alterboy"&gt;Alter Boy&lt;/a&gt;, &amp;amp; &lt;a href="http://www.purevolume.com/findingwindemere"&gt;Finding Windemere&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="http://www.theatticclub.com/"&gt;the Attic Club&lt;/a&gt;, an interesting teen club in a strip mall.

But when the practice is over, we must act. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Religion, as it exists throughout the world and through history, is practice. It prepares the mind with deep thoughts, meditation, and understanding. It trains you to make good decisions, to see when things aren't how they appear. It uses symbols and traditions and ritual actions to ingrain itself in your mind. It uses authority structures and leaders to help you become the kind of person you want to be. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But then you have to stop practicing. And you have to start living in the real world. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you first learned how to ride a bike, there's a good chance you had training wheels. Those training wheels allowed you to get a feel for riding upright, while practicing the motions of pedaling and steering. And then one day, the training wheels were removed, and you pushed off into the real experience. And that experience was completely different than what you had been doing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No matter how far you ride, no matter how tired you get, you will never go back. The training wheels have served their purpose, and whether you are Lance Armstrong, or someone who hasn't ridden in years - chances are you will never need those training wheels again. Next time you ride, you will simply jump on and go. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New Testament writers call this moving from shadows into truth. To them, the rituals, the symbolism, the structures of religion, had all served a purpose. But they were not the end point of human life - they were the beginning, and once the scaffolding of religion had fallen away, real human life could emerge. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is why Christianity is a unique phenomenon. Christianity is not the world's best religion - it is the moment at which one stops practicing, and starts living. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you need practice, then practice. If you need to learn, then learn. But then practice is over, and you have to take off the training wheels, and ride out into the world.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2009/11/08/forgiveness-thought/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2009/11/08/forgiveness-thought/</link><pubDate>Sun Nov 08 22:23:00 CST 2009</pubDate><title>Forgiveness thought</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>Think about this.Jesus went around forgiving people, and claiming the authority to forgive sins.

The idea is that when you’re building something, it’s better to start with the most basic version possible, so that you can see if the idea even works. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lately I’ve been thinking about a &lt;em&gt;minimum viable theology&lt;/em&gt;. What if, instead of jumping feet-first into a religion, complete with an intricate culture and thought-system, you could start with something basic, and work your way up?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn’t unprecedented. For Christians, this is exactly the function of the Bible — to carry you through from basic ideas, all the way to the complete picture. The Biblical story itself is about a people making this journey over many generations, each generation gaining a little more insight and truth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s also how Christianity was first presented to the Greek world. In Acts 17, Paul stands in front of Athens and &lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/2015/11/16/mars-hill"&gt;makes a remarkable speech&lt;/a&gt;, in which he quotes only Greek philosophers. Rather than citing verses from his own scriptures, Paul affirms and builds on things they already know. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So if we wanted to figure out a minimum viable theology, where would we start?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think we’d start with this: &lt;em&gt;Good wins&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Good Wins&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I was young, I stumbled across an idea in a book I was reading. The idea was this: &lt;em&gt;good eventually wins&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I read that, it shook me to my core. Not because it changed my beliefs or my thinking, but because this was the first moment that I was aware of this idea &lt;em&gt;as an idea&lt;/em&gt; — as a standalone concept that could be examined and evaluated, affirmed or denied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In that moment, I knew that I believed it — that, in fact, it was an idea I would never be able to escape. Unlike everything else I believed, this was unnassailable and unshakeable. It simply &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt;, and I would have to build my life around the fact that I believed it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an important sense, everything else I think proceeds from that. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before discussing it further, let me clarify a few things. Saying that &lt;em&gt;good eventually wins&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t mean that good is &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; winning, or that good is always on top, or that every winner is good. Quite the contrary. What it means is that even if vast evils are committed, and evil forces dominate—they will eventually be overturned. Over the long run, evil empires fall. Over the long run, good emerges triumphant. Over the long run, there is progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in order for us to evaluate this extraordinary claim, we first have to define what we mean by “good”. I’d suggest this definition: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Good is that which supports others. Evil is that which destroys others.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When looked at in that way, something should become clear. We all &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; goodness to spread. It’s always in our own best interest for other people to be good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consider a farmer who grows food to feed himself, and shares the surplus with his neighbors. He is behaving in a good way, and he wants his neighbors to be good as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now consider a thief who steals food from the farmer. He feeds himself by undermining other people’s ability to eat. He is behaving in an evil way—but he doesn’t want other people to be evil. Rather, he hopes that everyone else continues to be good. A society of thieves would be a miserable place for him to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the deep paradox at the heart of evil. Evil can only exist by virtue of good. Good does not need evil, but evil absolutely needs good. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means that good has potentially &lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/2015/08/07/infinite-morality-jesus"&gt;infinite reach&lt;/a&gt;, while evil is fundamentally self-limiting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This becomes clearer when our thief forms a gang with some other thieves. There’s an old saying that there is honor among thieves, and this is true. A gang of thieves must be built on trust, in order to work together and accomplish their heists. But this trust is in direct contradiction to what they spend their time doing: betraying the trust of others. They must attempt to maintain very different realities inside and outside of the group. They must be good within the gang, in order to be evil outside of it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a very difficult dynamic. How can you build trust and cooperation and goodness within a group, while acting with dishonesty and evil outside of it? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contrast this with a group of farmers who get together to form a co-op, built on mutual trust. Each of them is already behaving in a good and trustworthy way towards each other. Their actions in the co-op simply amplify that goodness and trust, and their behavior towards the outside world takes that trustworthiness even farther. The internal reality of the group is completely consistent with the external reality of the group. The goodness within the group reinforces the goodness outside of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The contrast becomes even more pronounced when we consider this from the perspective of memes. As a culture, we now think of a “meme” as a bit of text superimposed on a funny picture that get spread around the internet. But the original idea was broader: a meme is any idea that can get passed from person to person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good behavior and evil behavior are both memes. Both are ideas that can spread from person to person, as we unconsciously imitate others. We can see someone act in a good way, and be influenced to act in a good way as well. Or we can see someone act in an evil way, and be influenced to become evil ourselves. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But no one wants to live in an evil society. No one wants evil to spread, least of all someone running a criminal organization. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For our gang of thieves to be successful, they must be vigilant against the leakage of behaviors. If the trustworthy behavior within the gang were to &lt;em&gt;leak&lt;/em&gt; into how they deal with the outside world, their heisting days would be over. And if the non-trustworthy behavior outside of the gang were to &lt;em&gt;leak&lt;/em&gt; into the gang, the gang would explode.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The very ability of good and evil to spread &lt;em&gt;memetically&lt;/em&gt; tends to undermine the existence of the criminal enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not so for the farmer’s co-op. If their goodness spreads memetically, that’s only good for them. They don’t need to worry about the leakage of behaviors, because all of their behaviors are self-reinforcing. Any “leakage” or imitation of them just makes them stronger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based only on our basic definition of good and evil, I think something becomes clear. Over time, evil systems will tend to dissolve, as they undermine their own existence. Over time, good systems will tend to grow, as they affirm their own existence and the existence of their surroundings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that’s why I think that good wins.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2005/05/02/movie-shark-tale/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2005/05/02/movie-shark-tale/</link><pubDate>Mon May 02 10:06:00 CDT 2005</pubDate><title>MOVIE - Shark Tale</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>Good entertainment.

We're about to move into the New Testament, but before we do, I want to make sure I'm super clear as to the problems that were plaguing humanity, and the problems that Jesus believed he could solve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because how you understand Jesus and his context changes how you read the bible, and thus what you think Christianity &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt;. If you believe Jesus mostly came to implement a new way to get to heaven after death, then a very large chunk of the bible is going to seem irrelevant. If you believe that Jesus was primarily interested in reforming our ethical system, then the scriptures are going to be very frustrating. But if you think that maybe Jesus (and Israel before him) were trying to offer up an alternative vision of humanity, a humanity “outside the power of the devil”, a humanity free to flourish in its identity as the image-bearers of God - then your entire interaction with scripture will be transformed. And you may discover a dynamic much more profound than religion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So let's catalog the things we've been exploring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, we discussed how human consciousness created space for the awareness of our own mortality, how that awareness began to haunt us, and how it blossomed into an ever-present fear. This fear takes many forms, most of them unconscious. It drives our rivalries, our ambitions, our sense of self. It prevents us from doing things we want, and it coerces us into doing things we don't want.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can call this the &lt;em&gt;slavery of death&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Historically, this fear fueled the rise of oppressive empires, each one utilizing human fear to control the masses. The slavery of death was the beginning of actual physical slavery. But to those enslaved, the one holding power over them appeared to be wielding a dark magic, a control that extended far beyond their physical presence, and permeated every waking moment of the person oppressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus began the &lt;em&gt;worship of violence&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This kind of violence is like a virus. Once you have been the victim of it, you desire to exercise it yourself. When someone has hurt you, you want to hurt them in return. If you fail, your desire for violence will only grow. If you succeed, the person you have hurt will not “learn their lesson”, but will seek to return the violence, even more severe than the last time. It's a vicious cycle, always spiraling upwards and outwards, always escalating, always pulling us more and more into the desire for vengeance. No matter who ultimately loses, violence always wins. And the one who succeeds in totally decimating their enemy will have become distorted into a subhuman creature, possessed by vengeance, lust, and the desire to kill. Violence not only enslaves us, it robs us of our identities, and turns us into the tools of its total propagation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/03/11/references-christianity-anthropology"&gt;Walter Wink&lt;/a&gt; calls this the &lt;em&gt;Domination System&lt;/em&gt;. This is the empire behind all empires, the power that controls us even when we feel we are free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this world of total violence, stability could only be achieved by channeling the impulse for vengeance into something relatively harmless. And so the Domination System created the &lt;em&gt;scapegoat mechanism&lt;/em&gt;, choosing the weaklings and the human oddities for the mob to kill, joining society together in a dark unity. This was a “solution” which allowed society to flourish without ever needing to reduce violence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This, as &lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/03/11/references-christianity-anthropology"&gt;Rene Girard&lt;/a&gt; shows, was the source of all human religion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each of these systems built on the previous system, the whole structure gaining substance, taking shape, ceasing to operate as a system, beginning to act much more like an &lt;em&gt;entity&lt;/em&gt;. This is what the scriptures identify as the “works of the devil”, the “principalities and powers”, the “ruler of this world”. This is the power that held humanity hostage. And this is the power which the son of God appeared to destroy.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/04/16/sin-covet-judge/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/04/16/sin-covet-judge/</link><pubDate>Mon Apr 16 10:01:03 CDT 2012</pubDate><title>Sin, Covet, Judge</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>It is very common to hear Christians define "sin" as "missing the mark".

And it becomes very easy to see how everybody in the whole world could be &lt;em&gt;sinners&lt;/em&gt;. After all, nobody's perfect, right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But I'm convinced that the scriptures aren't talking about simple mistakes. They're talking about destructiveness - about our tendencies to harm and violate others, our desires to hurt and kill. This is a far more serious issue, and comes from a much more dangerous place. There is no crime in being fallible, but there is something very disturbing about the ways in which we destroy other human beings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This explains the bible's odd emphasis on &lt;em&gt;covetousness&lt;/em&gt;. It would seem to be a minor sin; don't we all wish we had our neighbor's car, or our banker's house? Don't we all wish we had a little more money or time? But the scriptures aren't condemning ambition, they're identifying something much more problematic:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our desire to destroy that which we don't possess.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We've all seen it -&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;If I can't have you, nobody will!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;I hope that celebrity falls flat on their face!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dear God, if you can't make me happy, at least make my friends miserable!&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This desire is one of the darkest we have. And so it makes the list of the ten commandments, the apostle Paul's major concerns, and even Jesus' main teachings. In the gospels, Jesus famously told the Pharisees that whoever looked at a woman lustfully (another word for &lt;em&gt;covetously&lt;/em&gt;) was committing adultery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Believe it or not, this was not said to make teenage boys feel guilty. Instead, Jesus is identifying how coveting turns the person of our attention into something subhuman, an object to be used and discarded at will. It is that which inspires us to destroy others - it is that which has destroyed our already broken relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But here's where things become deeply ironic. It is often those most concerned with &lt;em&gt;sin&lt;/em&gt; who are the most covetous, and the most involved in the destruction of others. Using the Law (or whatever other moral code we happen to have), we decide to evaluate the world. But that very evaluation poses a problem, because it requires us to judge by an external standard. And when that external standard blinds us to our own &lt;em&gt;internal&lt;/em&gt; covetousness, our desire takes over, and uses the Law to destroy everyone around us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the upshot of most of Paul's comments about the Law. This is what Jesus meant when he told the Pharisees that they were trying to pick out a speck in someone else's eye, while carrying a log in their own. This is why we are told not to judge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is not just that judging is &lt;em&gt;not nice&lt;/em&gt;. It is that judging blinds us to the real face of evil, both within ourselves and in others.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2015/02/27/what-transhumanism-and-why-should-christians-care/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2015/02/27/what-transhumanism-and-why-should-christians-care/</link><pubDate>Fri Feb 27 00:36:56 CST 2015</pubDate><title>What is Transhumanism?

It’s often coupled with stories of amazing new medical developments, like restoring hearing to the deaf, or sight to the blind. Sometimes it’s coupled with stories of scarier things, like robot invasions, or murderous artificial intelligences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You might be wondering, what is transhumanism? What does it mean, and why should I care? Or maybe, &lt;em&gt;why is Micah always talking about this?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At root, it’s actually pretty simple. &lt;em&gt;Transhumanism&lt;/em&gt; is basically just the idea that we can make the world better. We’re not stuck with how things are; we actually have the power to change things, and to do things differently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means that when we face problems like Ebola or cancer, we don’t simply sit back and say &lt;em&gt;this is how things have to be&lt;/em&gt;. Instead, we apply our God-given ingenuity to working out solutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And when we face issues like extreme poverty, we don’t simply accept that &lt;em&gt;this is how things are&lt;/em&gt;. Instead, we work to help those in need, and work harder to eliminate the things that caused the need to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether facing disease, poverty, or hunger, whether encountering the wounded, sick, or dying — we don’t simply throw up our hands in defeat. Instead, we set out to address the problem; we set out to improve the world. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transhumanism is about working on these kinds of problems, problems that affect the world on a really large scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s amazing, of course, is that humans have been able to do so much already. Just in the last century, we’ve seen the widespread adoption of indoor plumbing and electricity. The impact of these things has been incredible, from dramatic reductions in disease, to the health benefits of refrigerated food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The irony is that many people now act like things have always been this way; like we’ve always had electricity, plumbing, and indoor lights. In reality, of course, these technologies are barely two generations old. Not having had them is within memory of many people still alive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This lack of historical awareness can blind us to the fact that things can be better, that there is still plenty of room to improve the lives of people at every level of society. That, in turn, can make us apathetic, leading us to surrender our role in making the world a better place. Or even worse — it can make us hostile towards those who are working to change things for the good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the reality is that the world has been radically transformed, over and over again, by the actions of people just like you and me. From fire and agriculture, to space travel and particle accelerators — we create new things, cultivate new life, and enable new ways of living, working, and playing. We explore and learn and discover, we imagine and build and invent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have always been transforming. That is who we are — that is what it means to be human.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that means that we have the capability — &lt;em&gt;and the responsibility&lt;/em&gt; — to make things better. We need to fight the impulse towards apathy, and embrace our responsibility as human beings. We need to realize how far we’ve come — and how far we still can go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The future &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be shaped. The world &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be improved. Life &lt;em&gt;isn’t&lt;/em&gt; static, change &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We need to ask hard questions about the future. How can we solve the problems of global hunger? How will we deal with massive unemployment, if large parts of our economy become automated? What can we do to prevent the spread of biological weapons? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than approaching these questions with pessimism or fear, we need to approach them as problems to be solved with ingenuity, passion, and hard work. We need to see the future, not as something terrifying, but as a chance for doing good, and an opportunity to improve the lives of billions of people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s what transhumanism is about. Believing that we can change things. Recognizing that the world has transformed before — and will transform again. Thinking far enough ahead to see large-scale challenges, and larger-scale opportunities. Working towards making the world a better place for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the moment, very few self-proclaimed transhumanists are Christian. This means that the people seemingly most invested in the future of the world — in considering its challenges, and contemplating opportunities to make it better — are mostly secular.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'd like to change that. After all, Christianity is the religion that tells us we were made in the image of God, and charged with the care of all creation. Christianity is the religion whose prime directive is “love your neighbor as yourself”. Christianity is the religion which calls its followers to participate with God in the redemption, renewal, and reconciliation of the world. Christianity is the religion whose disciples were commanded to go out and heal the sick, feed the hungry, and bring life to the dead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is why I’m involved in helping to grow the &lt;a href="http://www.christiantranshumanism.org"&gt;Christian Transhumanist Association&lt;/a&gt;. We’re asking Christians to start thinking deeply about the challenges and opportunities of the future, and to start moving boldly and optimistically toward making the world a better place. We’re not suggesting a new idea, but an old one. We want Christians to wake up to what they claim to believe — and to connect more deeply with the heart and vision of their faith.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re interested in taking on these kinds of challenging questions, being a part of this growing discussion, and working on ambitious ways to improve the world, we want your ideas and your vision. We'd love for you to &lt;a href="http://www.christiantranshumanism.org"&gt;join us&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2008/03/02/the-rules-of-pull-throughs/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2008/03/02/the-rules-of-pull-throughs/</link><pubDate>Sun Mar 02 01:00:00 CST 2008</pubDate><title>The Rules of Pull-Throughs</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>To the uninitiated, the term "pull-through" may not mean much.

But it is a term ripe with meaning. Sometimes it masquerades as "pull-thru" or "pll-thrgh", but the latter is only prevalent among people who hate vowels, and presumably they will have stopped reading after the second character of this article.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"Pull-Through"&lt;/strong&gt;, or &lt;strong&gt;"Pull-Thru"&lt;/strong&gt;; &lt;em&gt;noun&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An empty parking space, which has an empty parking space directly in front of it, so that instead of stopping in the parking space one has chosen, one feels compelled to pull forward into the next parking space, thus completing the pull-through.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;A pull-through serves the useful function of allowing the driver to entirely avoid backing in or out of a parking space.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of terms need to be defined in relation to the Pull-Through:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Initiator&lt;/strong&gt;: the first parking spot one pulls into, directly attached to another empty spot.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Closer&lt;/strong&gt;: the final parking spot of the pull-through, directly in front of the Initiator.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taking The Pull-Through&lt;/strong&gt;: going through with the action, moving all the way from the Initiator to the Closer before stopping.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pull-Through Interruptus&lt;/strong&gt;: when someone pulls into the Initiator, but refuses to pull forward into the Closer, thus avoiding Taking The Pull-Through, and ruining the Pull-Through for everyone.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unbeknownst to the average driver, there are a complex series of rules that govern the manner in which pull-throughs may be treated. These rules are similar in nature to the rules for "Calling Shotgun", having accumulated over time, developing in native societies for ages before modern civilization discovered them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pull-Through Rule #1: &lt;/strong&gt;IF A DRIVER PULLS INTO A PARKING SPACE WHICH IS AN &lt;strong&gt;INITIATOR&lt;/strong&gt;, SAID DRIVER &lt;strong&gt;MUST&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;TAKE THE PULL-THROUGH&lt;/strong&gt;. IT IS A CARDINAL OFFENSE TO STOP SHORT OF THE FULL PULL-THROUGH!&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Are there any exceptions?" an insightful reader may ask. Well yes, there are. But we are not considering exceptions, we are considering rules. So let's consider some commonly-given excuses that are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; exceptions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. "Pulling through takes me farther away from the door!"&lt;/strong&gt; Suck it up, fella. The pull-through is its own reason and justification. You &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; pull-through because it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a pull-through. That's just common sense. It doesn't get any more logical than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. "If everyone did a pull-through, there would be no pull-throughs left".&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's just not using simple reasoning. Think about it: if everyone completed the pull-through when given the chance, they would tend to leave their parking space more quickly once done, thus freeing up more parking that could potentially become a pull-through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. "But this Pull-Through leaves me going the wrong way in a one-way lane!"&lt;/strong&gt; Someone should have thought of that before creating the Pull-Through. It is not your fault that the Pull-Through is facing the wrong direction. You still must Take The Pull-Through.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be continued...&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/02/13/existence-god/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/02/13/existence-god/</link><pubDate>Mon Feb 13 10:27:50 CST 2012</pubDate><title>The Existence of God?</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>I'm writing this for my atheist friends who see no reason or justification for believing in God - not to convince them, but to give them a window into my own thought processes, and an alternative to m...</description><content:encoded>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I'm writing this for my atheist friends who see no reason or justification for believing in God - not to convince them, but to give them a window into my own thought processes, and an alternative to many of the things they've probably encountered. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most arguments for theism end up suggesting something along the lines of a &lt;em&gt;first cause&lt;/em&gt; - that all events come from other events, and following these lines of causation, everything must ultimately come from a single point somewhere. This argument is vividly borne out in the modern picture of the big bang. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as many people rightly point out, &lt;em&gt;first cause&lt;/em&gt; doesn't have to mean &lt;em&gt;God&lt;/em&gt;. It could be that something quite stupid got the universe going - or it could even be that there are an infinite chain of "first causes" behind the first cause. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So those traditional theistic arguments don't help us out much. In fact, they mainly serve to reveal what &lt;em&gt;isn't&lt;/em&gt; relevant. We are not actually interested in the existence of a creator, we are interested in the existence of a creator who cares about us. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that gets tricky. How would we discover such a thing? How would we know if a super-intelligent being actually loves us?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the difference between theism and deism. Deism argues for a &lt;em&gt;first cause&lt;/em&gt; sort of God, but then tells us we can never expect to really find him. He remains forever detached and beyond us. Theism, on the other hand, makes a far more interesting claim - God not only cares, but is actively involved in the world. And so, if we are to test out theism, we can give up looking for the metaphysical limits of existence, and begin looking at the world in front of us. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's what I see. Every year, the world gets a little better. Diseases are cured, violence is reduced, injustices are eliminated. Even in down economies, the overall state of the world is improving. Just compare things &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt; to how they were a thousand or even a hundred years ago. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this isn't just true for human beings. All over the natural world, order is arising from chaos, complexity is increasing, life is springing from non-life. And it reaches beyond earth - the composition of the universe has gone from uniform hydrogen gas to highly complex stars, galaxies, and super-structures. And each generation of stars has led to greater and greater complexity, each one's death sending a payload of highly complex matter out into the universe, to become the seeds of the next generation of star growth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn't a meaningless trajectory - it's exactly what we humans value as most important about ourselves and the world. What it represents is the growth of cooperation and intelligence on every level of reality. We can even say (without too much of a stretch) that this is love filling the universe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But of course, there are explanations for this, including natural selection. And I would respond by pointing out that natural selection is only one principle, and we see this dynamic everywhere, even in places natural selection does not apply. But other principles can be brought up, and there is no doubt that we can capture each of these dynamics in some set of concrete principles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But then I would ask &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt;? Why is it that all of these principles conspire to endlessly increase cooperation and complexity? Why is it that reality itself seems to &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; life and organization and compassion?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And I suppose the answer would be: &lt;em&gt;it just is&lt;/em&gt;. There is no need for why, it's just the way things are. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And I would agree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if we accept this, then we've entered new territory. Because if we are simply saying &lt;em&gt;it just is&lt;/em&gt;, then we're no longer explaining away, we're describing. We've reached the endpoint of our chain of causes, and we're simply stating what we see. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And if we're saying that reality itself &lt;em&gt;seems to want&lt;/em&gt; the increase of cooperation and complexity and embedded intelligence and compassion, then we're not describing an atheistic reality, but a theistic one - one that cares for our ultimate well-being, one that works all our efforts together into one upward dynamic motion, one that is always bringing life out of non-life, and existence out of darkness. &lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2007/01/01/the-open-future-creators-with-god/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2007/01/01/the-open-future-creators-with-god/</link><pubDate>Mon Jan 01 03:25:00 CST 2007</pubDate><title>The Open Future - Creators with God</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>People talk about God having a plan for your life.

If God planned everyone's life in advance, why should we bother to live it? Even more, if God planned everyone's life in advance, how could we possibly change it? But we're told to seek God's plan for our lives, as if we could mess it up if we're not careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to present a different idea. In the Jewish bible, God acts as if the future is open, only loosely planned. He changes his mind. He feels sorry for things that have occurred. He lets people influence his decisions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe that is telling us something about the way God wants things to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the beginning, God created humanity "in his image". Jesus came to restore the image of God to humanity. And the result was, as Paul said, that we are no longer servants, no longer little children, but SONS, full-fledged heirs of God. Co-heirs with Jesus, as Paul said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This situation is described as having the Spirit of God living in us, having Jesus live with us, having full access to God, etc, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe, just maybe, that was the point of biblical history. Yes, God had a plan. Yes, he brought it to completion in Jesus. And as the result of that plan, God's presence has now been restored to humanity. Humanity has been united with God. And in that condition, humanity is no longer just little children, but has actually grown up, inheriting God's full rewards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Part of those rewards (among, "ruling on the earth", "judging the angels", and "owning all things") is the future. God has given us the future. Rather than God planning out the future for us, rather than God abandoning us to the future, God has joined with us so that we can be co-creators of the future with him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I propose that instead of seeing the future narrow into a thin line consisting of "God's true plan", we see that by uniting with God, the future expands infinitely. God's power infuses every situation in our lives with POSSIBILITY, possibility to make something much better, possibility to create a greater alternative than those previously considered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Isn't that a prominent message in the bible? Throughout the bible, people are confronted with difficult choices to make, situations that look impossible. But God steps in and changes the whole landscape of choices available. Moses was trapped between the Egyptians and the Red Sea. Joshua faced an impenetrable wall, and a land full of giants. The 1st-century Jews were looking for a way to be free of the Romans. In each situation, God stepped in and showed them choices that they never would have considered, choices that would have evaded their limited, normal thinking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The future is open, the future is ours to create. Draw deeply on God and create the unbelievable.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/the-dark-side-of-knowledge/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/the-dark-side-of-knowledge/</link><pubDate>Mon May 09 00:08:31 CDT 2016</pubDate><title>The Dark Side of Knowledge</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>The other day, I explored the story of Genesis, and its perplexing account of the corruption of mankind through [the knowledge of good and evil](http://micahredding.com/blog/the-tree-of-the-knowledge-...</description><content:encoded>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;The other day, I explored the story of Genesis, and its perplexing account of the corruption of mankind through &lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/the-tree-of-the-knowledge-of-good-and-evil"&gt;the knowledge of good and evil&lt;/a&gt;. I tried to unpack some of the overlooked dynamics of the story, to get at what it is telling us about humanity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In doing this, we ran straight into an incredibly paradoxical idea at the heart of that account. The idea is that knowledge is a good thing, a &lt;em&gt;godlike&lt;/em&gt; thing, an attribute of God intended to be possessed by humans. And yet, we are told that &lt;em&gt;knowledge can corrupt&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How can a good thing corrupt us?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We typically think of knowledge as being neutral or positive. Ancient scriptures are almost universally in favor of acquiring knowledge, and in a world shaped by science, we usually look down on people who are willfully ignorant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s as it should be. But just because knowledge is good, does not mean it is tame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or, more precisely, the &lt;em&gt;ability&lt;/em&gt; to possess knowledge isn’t tame. This is because the ability to possess knowledge is really the ability to imagine, to picture things as being different than we experience them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once we have that ability, we can do great things. We can imagine the sun as being spherical (which it really is) instead of a flat circle (which it appears to be). We can picture atoms as tiny solar systems, rather than never considering them at all. We can contemplate the steps necessary to build a steam engine, which never existed before humans, and has no analog in the natural world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can also imagine a future which is different than the present, or contemplate a past which no longer exists. We can invent new worlds, and call those worlds “stories”. We can peer into another’s eyes, and tell ourselves the thoughts that must be flitting through their mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a power that is indeed godlike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this power doesn’t just give us new abilities; it also exposes us to new dangers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine finding a rabbit in the forest, drawing a circle around that rabbit, and saying “Rabbit! Don’t leave this circle, or I will come back later, hunt you down, and make you regret it!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As soon as you leave, the rabbit will hop away. The rabbit doesn’t understand your threats, and so those threats have absolutely no power over it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, you can come back later and make good on your threats. But there is no point to that exercise—the whole point of a threat is get some behavior without having to actually enforce the consequences. And the only point in enforcing the consequences is to teach a lesson, so that future threats have more force to them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the other party can’t understand your threats, those threats lose all power. And if you’re the one threatening rabbits in the forest, you’re the one who looks like an idiot. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The situation is dramatically different with human beings. Humans can understand threats, they can imagine future consequences, they can contemplate repercussions, and they can learn lessons. And so you can absolutely draw a circle around a human being, and say “Don’t leave this circle, or I will come back later, hunt you down, and make you regret it!” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the human being believes you, you can control its behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, your ability to control another human being is not even dependent on your ability to do anything. All you have to do is make the other person &lt;em&gt;believe&lt;/em&gt; your threats, and you can exert control far beyond anything you are physically capable of. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In possessing the ability to understand threats, we expose ourselves to the power of threats—and a whole world of dark control becomes possible. Suddenly we can be controlled, manipulated, coerced, and enslaved. Suddenly we can be turned against our families, our friends, and even ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And once that power is unleashed, there is nothing that terrifies us more. The very possibility of being threatened and coerced now becomes its own looming threat, occupying our waking moments, driving us into an even deeper slavery—to the raw power of our fear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ability to possess knowledge is a double-edged sword. It unleashes great power, for both good and evil. It allows us to do great things, but it also exposes us to great dangers. It has been responsible for every great deed in history, and for every terrifying horror.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To the very extent that our imagination opens up infinite possibilities, it also opens up infinite harms. Of course, our imagination is a core part of us, and we wouldn’t want to escape it. And yet, in possessing the ability to imagine unseen worlds, we expose ourselves to untold dangers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And this is why it is called &lt;em&gt;the knowledge of good and evil&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2014/08/23/consumerism/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2014/08/23/consumerism/</link><pubDate>Sat Aug 23 12:42:31 CDT 2014</pubDate><title>Consumerism</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>When I think of consumerism, I think of companies without values — or more precisely, companies without opinions.

Most of it is written in symbols only familiar to those steeped in the Jewish religion. And the number of bizarre interpretations of it available make the book very confusing. But there are a few steps you can take to understand it better. We may not be able to figure out everything about it, but we can probably make out the main points. Here's how:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Realize that Revelation IS symbolic. This should just be common sense. If you think that literal scorpion-horses are going to be set free on the earth, or that plagues are unleashed by angels with literal bowls, then you have some problems in the way you interpret things. Most people, even if they deny it, do accept that Revelation is composed of symbols. That is VERY important to remember.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Realize that those symbols are Jewish. It has been said that Revelation is the most biblical book in the bible, because most of it is composed of quotes or direct references to other scriptures. Those symbols are not intended to be interpreted however any modern interpreter desires. They meant specific things to the Jewish-Christian people of the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Realize the scope of what Revelation says. Revelation was written to the 7 churches of Asia, giving them warnings about things that were going to happen. The things written in Revelation were going to fundamentally impact these people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) Realize it was all to happen SOON. At the beginning, through the middle, and at the end, the readers are warned that all of the foretold events would happen SOON. These events would concern the 7 churches, and they would happen to those people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5) Realize what the ending really is. Revelation ends with a scene of the New Jerusalem coming down from heaven to earth. Many people confuse the identity of the New Jerusalem, and so misunderstand the whole book. The New Jerusalem, as Revelation states, is the bride of Christ. What else is called the bride of Christ in the New Testament? Wouldn't that be the church? And notice that the New Jerusalem came DOWN, people didn't go UP to it. No; the New Jerusalem is something set up on earth, with evil people outside, but with gates always open to people wishing to enter. Also, the New Jerusalem is said to be built on the foundation of the apostles; the church was said to be built on the foundation of the apostles. The New Jerusalem is nothing but the victorious church.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once we realize that the New Jerusalem is the church, that the events prophesied were to happen soon and to the people Revelation was addressed to, and that the symbols are references to the Jewish religion (not modern day technology), then we are well on our way to realizing what Revelation is talking about.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/12/25/christmas/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/12/25/christmas/</link><pubDate>Tue Dec 25 08:06:49 CST 2012</pubDate><title>Christmas</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>As Christmas has approached, I’ve been reminded that traditional Christmas songs have embodied some of the most hopeful messages for humanity ever written.

Good will towards men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The whole earth is to be pacified under this baby’s feet. Nations are to turn away from war, the violent are to lay down their weapons, the weak are to rise up and flourish. And then humanity will become what it was always destined to be — the caretakers of creation, the cultivators of new life, the namers of the cosmos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This vision is so gradiose, that it is really only ever captured in song. Even angels must resort to melody to carry the message.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this is the message that lies behind everything else in the biblical account, snaking its way among the ups and down of Jewish history, finally bursting into the light with the birth of Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This baby will open a crack in history — becoming both the way by which this visison will come to be, and the first example of what this vision really means. In his life, he will act as the first true human, renewing and cultivating creation wherever he goes. He will embrace joy and good things, because he brings joy and good things to the world. He will show compassion, because that is what he is. He will speak truth, because truth is what he loves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the cosmos will bow, because here at last, a human walks as the child of God.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/why-christians-need-minimum-viable-theology/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/why-christians-need-minimum-viable-theology/</link><pubDate>Wed Feb 01 17:08:16 CST 2017</pubDate><title>Why Christians need a Minimum Viable Theology</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>I am a Christian, and part of what that means is that I am an heir of an incredibly dense and comprehensive cultural tradition.

I would call it a &lt;em&gt;maximal&lt;/em&gt; cultural tradition, as it has produced art, music, literature, language, buildings, societies, revolutions, philosophical thought—just to mention a few things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I take joy in all of that richness and depth, and want to claim just as much of it as I can, and help communicate it to others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But most Christians understand that you don’t &lt;em&gt;start&lt;/em&gt; with all of that. Nobody wakes up one day and suddenly believes in the doctrine of transubstantiation, the consubstantial nature of the trinity, or the non-use of instruments in worship. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, they start with something much more direct—a desire to be &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@micahredding/what-does-it-mean-to-be-a-christian-721ac39a1c7e#.eewdl3gfs"&gt;a follower of Christ&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because Christians are on a mission to spread the message, they take this into account in how they communicate Christianity to others. Evangelical Christians have taken this so far, they’ve found ways to express the message in &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BL9lNVHANwI/?taken-by=micahredding"&gt;comic books&lt;/a&gt; and tracts that have been distributed to every truck stop and phone booth in the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The message is usually presented like this: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;God so loved the world, that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him will not perish, but will have eternal life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We might call this the &lt;em&gt;minimum viable&lt;/em&gt; version of the Christian story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And among many people, in many parts of the culture, telling it like this has been very compelling. But an increasing number of people can’t even read the above sentence without balking. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just saying the word &lt;em&gt;God&lt;/em&gt; sounds implausible, or worse, evil. Isn’t God anti-human? This God has a &lt;em&gt;Son&lt;/em&gt;?—What is this, medieval superstition? Why would any God worth its salt care about what you &lt;em&gt;believe&lt;/em&gt;? We’re supposed to find it credible to talk about &lt;em&gt;eternal life&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this point, we Christians have two options. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can pursue a path called &lt;em&gt;apologetics&lt;/em&gt;, and attempt to prove our position on all of those things using complex arguments about philosophy and science. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One problem with this is that it’s very complicated. Most people are not going to pause in the middle of reading your church tract to go get a degree in philosophy, and see whether your arguments hold up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A deeper problem is that it’s very fragile. In most apologetics presentations, everything hinges on you being right about an incredibly long list of specific things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People sense this, and whether or not they know where you went wrong, they know that you’re not omniscient, and it’s likely that you made a mistake somewhere along the way. If I was being told some of this stuff, I might get to the end, and say, “Well, it all sounds right, but I just don’t buy it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can berate those people all you want, but for the most part, this is a reasonable position to take.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, apologetics isn’t the only option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of pursuing apologetics, we could pursue what I call &lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/minimum-viable-theology-good-wins"&gt;minimum viable theology&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Minimum viable theology isn’t about proving our particular conception of things to be correct. Rather, it is about creating a context in which a &lt;em&gt;conversation&lt;/em&gt; about our different beliefs and perspectives becomes reasonable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What if we could have a shared context in which to talk about “good”, about “meaning”, about things out there that are bigger than we are? What if we could talk about “faith”, “belief”, and “religion” not as things that are anti-rational, but as things that are positive and core to the human experience?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We don’t actually need to have a shared worldview or metaphysical understanding to get to this conversation. All we need is to be able to show that from within whatever worldview you have, these categories start to show up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And I think we can. This is the conversation before the conversation, so to speak. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many people today, just “telling them Christianity” doesn’t really work. We’ve sometimes responded to that failure by resorting to arguments and approaches which only make the problem worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But I think we have the opportunity to take a different approach, to pursue conversation and open-ended dialogue, by stepping into the worldview of others, and finding the theology hidden within it. This approach feels much more like &lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/2015/11/16/mars-hill"&gt;the way Paul engaged the pagan world&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it feels much more like Christ, who entered &lt;em&gt;our world&lt;/em&gt; to do the exact same thing for us.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/01/03/ancient-israelite-violence-and-christian-view-old-testament/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/01/03/ancient-israelite-violence-and-christian-view-old-testament/</link><pubDate>Tue Jan 03 00:56:47 CST 2012</pubDate><title>Ancient Israelite Violence and The Christian View of The Old Testament</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>Some atheist friends of mine are [having a discussion](http://lucidlogic.blogspot.com/2012/01/homosexual-being-christians.html) about this verse in Leviticus:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a man lies with a male as with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination; they shall surely be put to death; their blood is upon them. (Leviticus 20:13)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Naturally, they are horrified, and question how anyone could follow a God that commands killing people like this. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their problem, I think, is that they haven't contemplated just how &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; killing goes on in the Jewish scriptures, and so they haven't experienced their horror at a large enough scale. If they had, they would be asking much tougher questions, and provoking much more interesting answers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the Christian understanding of the Old Testament? What are we supposed to do with it? What does it mean to have it as part of our scriptures?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It seems like the simplest way to address that question is with a story. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;~ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine that you are an early American pioneer, traveling westward towards Oregon, with a wagon train full of people eager to settle the new frontier. The journey begins well, but as you reach and begin to cross the treacherous mountains, winter descends. Soon you are stranded in a blizzard, barely making progress, trying your best to survive and move forward. Week after week, you trudge on, growing sicker and more hungy every day. One member of the party becomes so weak, he has to be carried on a stretcher by several of his friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, one night, no one can go any further. The food has run out, most of the people are so tired they can barely walk, and everyone has lost hope. As you all huddle together for what may be your last night on earth, a brightness penetrates your feverish mind. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What follows is the most troubling and fearsome vision you could ever imagine. In the midst of monstrous sights and images, the voice of God comes to you, and begins to tell you the way forward. You wake up in the morning with a message for the entire camp. And the first step is a horrific one: you must let the weakest member of the party die, and then consume his corpse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is a terrible moment. But it hardens everyone's determination for the battle for survival which begins. Step by step, you deliver God's instructions, and the difficult choices are made. The dead are eaten, frostbitten fingers and toes are cut off, and you issue commands more strict than those of any dictator. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Somehow, miraculously, your party survives. You make it through the blizzard, over the mountains, and into the Oregonian promised land. There, you begin to build a new society on the principles that came to you that dark night. Everyone carries with them the scars of their experience, but the intense determination that comes from the journey they've been through. And &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donner_Party"&gt;the story of your survival&lt;/a&gt; is passed down again and again, to help each new generation understand the difficult decisions and sacrifices their ancestors had to make.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fast-forward to the present. Oregon society has grown and flourished, first building on the principles delivered to you in the storm, then gradually developing other methods of organizing and regulating civilization. Your vision has been written down in the history books as a foundational element of Oregonian culture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People have different opinions about this vision. Some people think you were suffering snow-induced hallucinations. Others think it was truly a miraculous communication. The first group has to deal with difficult questions about where your ideas and determination came from. The second group has to deal with difficult questions about God's real stance on eating corpses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But everybody agrees on the following facts. The instructions from that vision insured the survival of your community. Without them, everyone would have died. And yet, eating corpses and cutting off fingers isn't the way in which society should operate now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;~ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is similar to how Christians view the Old Testament. It contains a set of laws given to an ancient desert tribe, to help them survive and flourish. Some Christians feel that these laws were developed by humans in response to difficult situations they faced. Others feel that God delivered those laws, altering his commands to the world that existed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first group has to deal with difficult questions about the true uniqueness of some of these ancient ideas. The second group has to deal with difficult questions about God's real moral stance on killing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But everybody agrees on the following facts. Those laws and instructions formed a society unique in the history of the world, one that survived with a resilience that is difficult to imagine. Through conquest, war, and near destruction, they remained steadfast in their cultural identity and commitment. And yet, those laws and instructions aren't the kind of thing that should run a society today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are legitimate questions, like whether God is a pragmatist who makes ethical decisions based on the situation. But nothing in that discussion changes anything about the heroism and significance of those accounts. And nothing changes its value for us today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The value is this. By seeing the difficult choices and struggles and sacrifices our ancestors faced, we learn. We learn what it means to be human, what it means to make difficult decisions and suffer for it, what it means to see what we value ripped away. And in that process, we discover what it is that truly matters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is always an individual thing, and every individual faces it. Jesus faced it in the wilderness, where he was led to be tested. In those empty spaces, he confronted all the stories and archetypes that came before. He saw the kings and the prophets trace out their lives and their downfalls. He saw the priests and the law-breakers struggle for power. He saw leader after leader face their enemy, only to discover the weakness within themselves. And in confronting each of those images, he saw what it was that was truly unique, truly meaningful in all of them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then he left the desert to go live that out. Not as a life course plotted out from the Levitical commands, but a life course driven by the courage, determination, and sacrifice he saw written there.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/01/01/2012-week-week-changes/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/01/01/2012-week-week-changes/</link><pubDate>Sun Jan 01 17:26:48 CST 2012</pubDate><title>2012 week-by-week changes</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>Read the setup [here](http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/01/01/new-years-resolve-change).

&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Week 1: Drink no soda.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;If anything, this experiment had a negative impact on my life. But I discovered that I really didn't need or miss it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Week 2: A world without coffee.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Argggghhh!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Week 3: Drink 5-hour energy every day!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;I didn't do well with this one. I would forget to take one until late in the day, and then would only drink a half-bottle (recommended dosage, but a little light-weight). I don't think it affected me very much.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Week 4: A week without time!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;This went so well, I forgot a new week had started, and it was Tuesday before I began the next week...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Week 5: No cream in my coffee, no milk, no liquid dairy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tough.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Week 6: No data plan on my phone!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Meaning, my phone has full functionality when I have a wi-fi signal, and the rest of the time is more or less like an average phone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WEEK 7: No restraints!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Meaning, no more restrictions like these last few. :)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WEEK 8: Get up earlier every day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Started with 7am, and worked backwards.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WEEK 9: Return to Tim Ferriss eating patterns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Feel a lot better&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WEEK 10: Go to bed before 10pm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sorta...&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WEEK 11: Hand-wash an item of clothing every day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apparently, drying is the biggest part of washing.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WEEK 12: This week I'm doing three things: NOT drinking coffee or tea before bed, taking back up shaving cream (which I haven't used in years), and carrying around my new Platypus water bottle. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WEEK 13: "Go out" every evening, do something interesting every night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WEEK 14: No wheat, yes sugar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unless under the influence of Mormons... ;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WEEK 15: No talk radio, no podcasts, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happier&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WEEK 16:&lt;br/&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2005/04/05/brickhouse-show-is-a-go/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2005/04/05/brickhouse-show-is-a-go/</link><pubDate>Tue Apr 05 19:50:00 CDT 2005</pubDate><title>BRICKHOUSE SHOW IS A GO</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>The Brickhouse show is the NEXT BIG THING, guys!

The idea is to see if we can construct a minimal theological starter kit, using only reasonable assumptions. The first entry is about &lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/minimum-viable-theology-good-wins"&gt;why good wins&lt;/a&gt;. You should start there.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The Theistic Premise&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Almost every society in history, from ancient goat-herders to scientists on the search for extra-terrestrial intelligence, have embraced what I call “the theistic premise”. This is simply the idea that &lt;em&gt;there's someone bigger out there&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, these societies have held wildly different notions as to what these hypothetical beings would be like—the SETI researchers are looking for beings similar to the ancient Roman gods, while others are hoping to find something more like the God of the Greek philosophers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But regardless of whether we’re talking about an alien species, mystical beings, the &lt;a href="http://www.simulation-argument.com/simulation.html"&gt;creators of a simulation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/omega-point-theory"&gt;super-beings of the far future&lt;/a&gt;, or something we have yet to envision—all of these societies have taken it for granted that human beings are not alone at the pinnacle of existence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This &lt;em&gt;theistic premise&lt;/em&gt; has driven both great good and great evil. It has fueled the construction of cities and civilizations, it has pushed explorers and scientists past the limits of the known world. It was the original force behind our desire to understand the stars, and it was the philosophy that launched the space race.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without it, humanity would not have come this far. As a result, its imprint is indelibly on us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;A Reality With No Ceiling&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even without adding any other details or assumptions, the theistic premise has huge practical ramifications. If we assume that there’s someone bigger out there, then our reality &lt;em&gt;has no ceiling&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intelligence, wisdom, and knowledge are not bounded by the world we know. Compassion, creativity, and imagination do not top out with the limits of our experience. Even what it means to be a &lt;em&gt;person&lt;/em&gt; can no longer be defined by reference to human anatomy. Our limited experience is radically decentralized, and our ability to contemplate the &lt;em&gt;possible&lt;/em&gt; becomes a dynamic force in human life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, it completely shapes what we believe we are capable of.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a reality with no ceiling, it’s plausible that we could go from traveling on foot, to flying through the air at hundreds of miles per hour. In a reality with no ceiling, it’s conceivable that we could go from farming, to collecting rocks on the moon, in just generations. In a reality with no ceiling, it’s reasonable to think that we could double life expectancy in just one lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if reality is limited, then none of these things seem reasonable. Without the theistic premise, we have no reason to expect that things can be fundamentally different than they are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At its core, the theistic premise is simply the claim that reality is unlimited. If reality is unlimited, then there’s someone bigger out there. If there’s no one else out there, then reality is severely constrained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The Fermi Paradox &amp;amp; The New Pascal’s Wager&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This conclusion is nothing more than a simple consideration of the nature of time, space, and probability. If you have an intelligent designer around, life can be created non-randomly. But even chance gets around to things eventually—whether that’s monkeys churning out the works of Shakespeare, or the spontaneous emergence of super-intelligent life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All chance needs is a big enough universe, and enough rolls of the die.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But we seem to have a big enough universe, with plenty of space and time. This means that if there’s &lt;em&gt;no one&lt;/em&gt; bigger out there, then something else is fundamentally limiting the existence of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that’s very bad news for us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is why the &lt;a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/fermi-paradox.html"&gt;Fermi Paradox&lt;/a&gt; is so worrying. Reality appears to be very big in every direction we can measure. So if there is no one else out there, then it must be constrained in some other way we cannot measure. Which would have ominous implications for the future of the human race.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If there is no one else out there, it probably means all intelligent species, across all space and time, die out. Quickly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the realization at the core of all the recent interest in the &lt;a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/read/elon-musk-simulated-universe-hypothesis"&gt;Simulation Argument&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://new-god-argument.com/"&gt;New God Argument&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQOyJUDTKdM"&gt;Transcension Hypothesis&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="http://mason.gmu.edu/~rhanson/greatfilter.html"&gt;Great Filter&lt;/a&gt;. This whole topic has been called the new &lt;a href="http://us1.campaign-archive1.com/?u=78cbbb7f2882629a5157fa593&amp;id=986df5e525&amp;e=7cef4a3b12"&gt;Pascal’s Wager&lt;/a&gt;—because &lt;em&gt;are we alone?&lt;/em&gt; is not idle speculation, it’s a key indicator of our own future potential. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So we return to our premise in yet another form. If we have a future, then there’s someone bigger out there. If there’s no one bigger out there, then we have no future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;We Are Not Alone&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The theistic premise works just as well across religious, philosophical, and scientific contexts, because it assumes no metaphysics and no knowledge other than what we all experience. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When contemplating our own existence, we are inevitably led to question: Are we the greatest thing there is? Or is there something greater?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our answer to that question leads us in one direction or another. It leads us to either seek out that which is greater, and to aspire towards that *greater*ness ourselves—or to seek meaning in a reality with hard limits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For all of human history, those have both been live options. And there have been brave individuals who made both options work brilliantly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But for the majority of human society, it was worth holding out for hope. It was worth believing in our own future. It was worth trusting that there was someone bigger out there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that’s true for me as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If God is possible, then anything is possible. If God is impossible, then nothing is possible.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I choose to believe in the future, in humanity, and most of all, in possibility. Therefore, I accept the theistic premise, that there is someone bigger out there. I choose hope. And because I choose hope, I choose to believe that we are not alone.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2011/10/14/thought-baptism/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2011/10/14/thought-baptism/</link><pubDate>Fri Oct 14 10:05:16 CDT 2011</pubDate><title>Thought on baptism</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>Baptism is a ceremony or ritual where some individual pledges themselves to a larger religious group or movement.

John saw it as a pledge to repentance, Peter saw it as a pledge to forgiveness, Paul sees it as a pledge to death. Wearing a cross, like wearing a &lt;a href="http://www.kesterbrewin.com/2011/08/18/now-i-am-become-death-the-jolly-roger/"&gt;skull and crossbones&lt;/a&gt;, was a declaration that one had passed out of the systems of the world and into the realm of death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm wondering if there's something else at work as well. To me, early Christianity was the &lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/2011/10/02/christianity-against-religion"&gt;rejection of ritual and religion&lt;/a&gt;, the move from metaphysics to real-world engagement. So at this heart of ritual-rejection, we have an enacted ritual. Maybe this isn't as hypocritical as it seems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe baptism was the ritual to end all rituals, the cleansing from a system of impractical abstraction, and the rebirth as a being freed from religion. Maybe for one tied to ceremony, one needs a ceremony to allow one to leave. Maybe for Jews whose religious journey had begun with a cleansing, a cleansing was needed for the end of their religious journey. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John was baptizing into whatever was coming. Peter was baptizing into what had come. Paul was baptizing into a new identity. And maybe all of them were baptizing out of ritual and into life.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2007/05/16/its-a-wonderful-life/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2007/05/16/its-a-wonderful-life/</link><pubDate>Wed May 16 00:58:00 CDT 2007</pubDate><title>It's a Wonderful Life</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>I realized that I am a fortunate person.

Even when all kinds of little things in my life are going wrong (my car's radiator and AC condenser got smashed in, leaving me with radiator repair debt and no AC; I dropped a glass bottle of tea in a convenience store and it smashed, leaving the cashiers mean and unhappy), lots of big things are going right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like how our speakers went out this weekend in Paducah, KY, and after our manager made a few calls, a guy I've never met bought us a MUCH more expensive set of new ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you think about it, that's a pretty profound thing to have happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-micah&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/existentialism/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/existentialism/</link><pubDate>Mon Jan 25 20:16:47 CST 2016</pubDate><title>Existentialism</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>If you’ve ever thought deeply about life, or perhaps experienced something that set you back, and disrupted everything you thought you knew — you might have ended up floating in despair. 

In this sta...</description><content:encoded>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;If you’ve ever thought deeply about life, or perhaps experienced something that set you back, and disrupted everything you thought you knew — you might have ended up floating in despair. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this state, it might seem that nothing makes sense. Or, more perversely, that all the things you value have lost their significance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is where existentialism comes from. It’s often thought of primarily as a philosophical problem, but it’s pretty clearly an emotional one as well. In fact, the philosophical problem wouldn’t &lt;em&gt;be&lt;/em&gt; a problem, if it weren’t for the emotional need that drives it — the sense that we &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; meaning, that we &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to find things to value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, existentialism is thought to come from a loss of belief in God. Without a grounding force in the universe to believe in, existentialist philosophers were cast adrift, searching and struggling for something to hold on to. The most ambitious of these philosophers claimed to be perfectly happy in this state, or to find the freedom of this kind of free-fall exhilirating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But more than a century into this thinking, people still don’t seem to be satisfied with that answer. Claiming to be ‘perfectly fine’ with existential free-fall seems like a case of protesting too much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Religious people might point to this triumphantly, as the evidence of what atheism leads to. But they aren’t safe from it either. In fact, there’s all kinds of religious language for this sort of thing: Mother Teresa spent a lot of time in her own &lt;em&gt;dark night of the soul&lt;/em&gt;, Christians often talk about missing a feeling of God’s presence, and even Jesus cried out, “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It would seem that we’re dealing with a universal human problem—perhaps made more pressing by rapid change or by new beliefs—but universally human nevertheless. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think that’s okay. When things fall apart, or the way we frame the world doesn’t quite work anymore—a lot of things start unraveling. Some things we know, many things we’re not even aware of. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we had a close relationship with our dad, and in some long-lost part of our memories, we associate him with childhood trips to get ice cream—then when that relationship changes, even our sense of taste may be disturbed. One thing moves, even without our awareness, and our whole sense of self may end up tumbling down like Jenga sticks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think this is what existentialism is, really: the feeling that our &lt;em&gt;self&lt;/em&gt; is a jumble of incoherent pieces that no longer fit together. In a lot of ways, this is just part of the natural process of change—when we move, we have to rebuild in the new place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s important is that we don’t get stuck there—in between the old and the new. What’s important is that we start to rebuild. And maybe we’re in a time where we have to get better at rebuilding, and have to rebuild more often. Things are moving and shifting ever more frequently, and it impacts us more than we know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can’t keep from experiencing disruption—and even to try would be more destructive. But we can get good at getting back up and building again—sometimes with a new set of pieces mixed in with the old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every time we do, we’re expressing a sort of faith. Not in the past, or in some structure that is slipping away, or we are leaving behind—but in the hope of what is yet to come, the joys we are yet to experience, the magnificent things we have yet to build. Every time we rebuild, our vision of the future gets bigger, more pieces are fitted in, and it all grows more nuanced, more intricate, more complex. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is as if we were driving on a long highway with a vast and beautiful city on the horizon. Sometimes the road dips, and we lose sight of the city for a while. But every time the road rises again, the city comes back into view, suddenly clearer and more complete and more realized than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2010/03/31/building-the-new-world/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2010/03/31/building-the-new-world/</link><pubDate>Wed Mar 31 16:47:08 CDT 2010</pubDate><title>Building The New World</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>The earth is an open globe in a wide-open universe.

We do not have to be constrained. We do not live in a world of scarcity. We are free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We must realize that humanity lives by cooperation. From supermarkets to families to farming, we live by working with others peacefully and cooperatively. If we all suddenly stopped caring about others, our world would dissolve in a single bloody day. The fact that we exist testifies to the truth of our nature - humans care for and cooperate with each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And yet there are some people selling fear. They tell us that if there were no bombs, criminals would run wild. They tell us that if they didn't build fences, we would be invaded. Yet these things are clearly not true. These people are running a mafia-like protection racket - they threaten us with "dangers", then tell us we need protection, all the while dealing the danger they claim they are saving us from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State power claims that its violence is responsible for the existence of our society. They take credit for the organization and cooperation of the people, all the while applying distortion and pressure to that cooperation, pushing it to its eventual breakdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their claims are clearly false. Society exists because we cooperate, because we assist each other, because even the bad people care about others, because the world is overwhelmingly empathetic. State violence is an unwanted and unneeded coating on the love of humanity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To realize the New World, we need to reject the claims that violence and coercion make the world work. We need to accept that peace and cooperation are already here, that they are the only true success humanity has ever had, and that our best tools for making the world better will be the powerful rejection of force and violence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But how will we have a world without the FDA keeping our food clean? Without the military keeping out terrorists? Without the AMA making sure doctors know what they are doing?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We must realize that these violence-backed institutions DO NOT ACCOMPLISH THESE THINGS NOW. We must build the true solutions, built on willing cooperation, just as humanity has always done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Examples abound. Organizations like &lt;a href="http://www.ul.com"&gt;Underwriters Laboratories&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.consumerreports.org"&gt;Consumer Reports&lt;/a&gt; have successfully provided unbiased accountability and standards for almost a century. The Red Cross has aided victims of violence and natural disasters all over the world. College accreditation is a process by which schools voluntarily strive to meet a set of cooperatively-generated higher standards. THESE are the organic economy - the thriving force of human cooperation that truly runs the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These things WORK, and they work well, and they are much freer of violence, bias, and corruption than similar force-based institutions. Whenever humanity opens itself to creative and non-violent solutions, the organic economy rushes in to fill the need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To achieve the New World, we can begin building organizations and cooperative associations to displace the violence-based "solutions" we have now. We can grow the organic economy in our own neighborhoods and cities. We can meet needs as we see them, we can make the world better by solving human problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You don't have to wait on a utopian future. You can do this now, on both large and small scales. All of the things that make our world great were created without violence, by people just like you.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2008/09/18/daring-ravine-driving-our-first-day-in-colorado/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2008/09/18/daring-ravine-driving-our-first-day-in-colorado/</link><pubDate>Thu Sep 18 10:12:54 CDT 2008</pubDate><title>Daring Ravine Driving - our first day in Colorado</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>It was our first day in Colorado.

The only trouble was getting our trailer and equipment TO the castle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turns out, they don't make castles for easy trailer-access.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The helpful castle residents informed us we would need to take our trailer out a trail they called the "Fire Road". It would lead us up a steep mountain overtop the castle, and finally to the castle's back door.  And half-way through, we would need to reverse the car and trailer, and take the whole contraption backwards to the entrance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Video can't really capture the fact that a huge ravine lies directly to your side.

Not only were there large-scale barriers between Catholics and Protestants, but seemingly every Protestant church had fractured along many trivial lines, every single division marking a hard and formal barrier to fellowship or relationship with Christians on the other side. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the early instigators of the movement had himself come from the &lt;em&gt;Old-Light Anti-Burgher Seceder Presbyterian church&lt;/em&gt;, each term in that title designating a historic division, and a group of people that were no longer allowed to participate in the work or fellowship of the community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Something seemed very wrong about this, and many people were looking for a solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The answer that struck the leaders of the Restoration Movement was to pursue a path of theological minimalism. If people were divided over political alliances, they would avoid political entanglements. If people were divided over the nuances of different creeds, they would abandon creeds in favor of the scriptures. If people were split about worship styles, they would pursue the simplest forms of worship possible. If people were divided by labels, they would give up labels in order to be simply Christians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In every way, they pursued unity by boiling down Christianity to its bare essentials. If they could arrive at the essence of Christianity, with no extra restrictions, no additional requirements, no added barriers, then every Christian would simply be a brother or sister, another child of God. And Jesus’ unity prayer would be fulfilled:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That they may be one, just as we are one...so that the world will know that you sent me, and you have loved them just as you have loved me...” (John 17:22-23)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The result was a string of simple, populist churches springing up across the country. They were organically connected, with no hierarchy or central organization. Every congregation appointed people to serve their community’s needs, and nothing more was necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the early leaders even suggested that a church was simply wherever two or more Christians happened to be gathered together, echoing Jesus’ words: “Where two or three are gathered in my name, there am I among them.” (Matthew 18:20)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In all kinds of ways, this dynamic young movement was shaping the world around them. They inspired others to work for and realize greater unity, they changed the conversation in the broader religious culture, and they allowed many people to live their faith in greater freedom than they had ever known.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But over time, the emphasis of this young movement began to shift. It’s easy to transition from focusing on simplicity, to demanding simplicity from others. And that’s exactly what happened. Instead of just practicing simple and inexpensive worship styles (that all could join in, rich or poor, skilled or unskilled), they began criticising other people for worship styles that were not simple enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soon, they had created all kinds of new divisions, based around different levels of greater and lesser simplicity. Worse, the arguments over these divisions led people to try to justify their choices by appealing to scripture — almost universally with badly out-of-context and misapplied verses. Instead of just defending their choices as an attempt to fulfill Jesus’ prayer for unity, they developed deep and convoluted arguments to try to demonstrate that their choices were the only ones acceptable to God.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end, these churches became weighed down with a complex and speculative theology, grown from the scar tissue of countless battle wounds, as the movement fractured again and again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, the Churches of Christ retain some of that original vitality, a vitality which often pops up in surprising places and in surprising way. But they also retain the scar tissue, the battle wounds, and the baggage of that long history of division.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The movement that started out as the pursuit of Jesus’ unity prayer, ended up as another monument to division. The movement that started out by opposing man-made barriers, created new, unprecedented barriers of their own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But I don’t write this to condemn. I write this to give hope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is not too late for the Churches of Christ to return to their original cry for simplicity and unity. To do so will require sacrifice, humility, and a willingness to be led by God. And it will require elevating the scriptures above our opinions, letting go of what is neither biblical nor sound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are the four things I believe we must do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;1. Abandon unscriptural theology&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the heat of countless religious debates, some Church of Christ preachers came up with arguments and theological frameworks that were neither biblical, nor compatible with the New Testament. Rather than appeal to unity and simplicity as their predecessors had done, they appealed to ideas about religious ethics that appeared nowhere in the scriptures, and strained the credulity of everyone who heard them. And yet generations of preachers clung to these ideas like they were a life raft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is time to let go. It is our moral duty to let go. The scriptures want to be read as they are, not through an artificial lens we have created for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;2. Embrace all Christians&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;A motto in the early Restoration Movement was “&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_churches_and_churches_of_Christ#Slogans"&gt;Christians only, not the only Christians&lt;/a&gt;”, but the Churches of Christ have sometimes turned this on its head. Rather than accept any obedient and believing Christian as a brother or sister in Christ, they have often required that these Christians be re-baptized by a Church of Christ minister, apparently feeling that belief in and obedience to Christ was not sufficient for salvation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is dangerous ground, biblically speaking. Christ and the apostles set out simple instructions, and adding anything to this gospel is not only wrong, it invites some of the worst condemnation in the scriptures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;3. Emphasize Baptism&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the things that the Churches of Christ have often focused on is baptism. And rightly so — baptism is incredibly significant in the New Testament, precisely because it is the act of giving up our identity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is why Paul can say that he was &lt;em&gt;crucified with Christ&lt;/em&gt;, and that other Christians were &lt;em&gt;buried in baptism&lt;/em&gt;. He isn’t talking about what baptism looks like, or making an abstract metaphysical point — he’s suggesting that it is this act of publicly identifying with Jesus that destroyed an old identity, and allowed a new one to be formed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We sometimes downplay this by suggesting that in baptism we are “turning our backs on sin”. But for Paul, it was far more significant than that. In publicly identifying as a Christian, he had not only abandoned his old beliefs and ways of living, he had abandoned his entire world, his station in life, everything that had given him meaning or value or significance. He lost it all, and it is precisely through that tremendous loss that he discovered a new and better identity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the same way, Christians of the first century abandoned their religious, social, and cultural status, and often their possessions and their lives. Baptism was a moment when, in a very real sense, one person died, and a new person was born.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is why Paul can say that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here there is no Greek or Jew, circumcised or uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave or free, but Christ is all, and is in all. (Colossians 3:11) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;And...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, nor is there male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus. (Galatians 3:28)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In identifying as Christians, all of these racial, social, and cultural identities had been abandoned, and all that was left was the binding love of Christ. If we miss this, we miss the power and significance of the early church.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;4. Share Communion&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the New Testament, Christians expressed their newfound identities by gathering to eat together, sharing their food and their compassion over a common table. This was called the “Love Feast” and “The Lord’s Supper”, because in this meal, a new family was being built — a family that in a striking fashion, brought together slaves and slave-owners, rich and poor — living out in a concrete way the peace and the kingdom of God.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This practice was so important to Paul that in 1 Corinthians 11, he takes his readers to task for it. When eating together, many of the wealthy people had begun eating first, leaving the poorer individuals to pick up the scraps. This was repulsive because it went against the whole purpose of the meal, and contradicted everything they were supposed to be doing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This practice is something we can reclaim and embrace. But we must embrace it with the full meaning and significance that the scriptures give to it — not as one of many rituals, but as an expression of the heart of Christian identity, and the all-embracing love of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;These four things would mark a return to the Restoration Movement, a return to calling for and creating Christian unity. And they would revive a minimalist theology based around the core elements of New Testament Christianity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But they require sacrifice. To return to the simplicity of New Testament Christianity, we must abandon the things we have added to it. To return to the power and signficance of the early church, we must re-embrace their spirit and their purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps then we would have a true Restoration Movement, one that not only brings about Christian unity, but goes on to play a part in the healing of the world.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2005/08/01/stateless/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2005/08/01/stateless/</link><pubDate>Mon Aug 01 03:34:00 CDT 2005</pubDate><title>Stateless</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>I just realized I'm the most geographically ambiguous person I know.

Apparently, they are. I've never really been around those kind of Christians. Apparently these are the "evangelicals".&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was raised in a really conservative church, but it wasn't like this. We didn't believe in speaking in tongues, in being overly emotive about Jesus, or in letting kids testify and harp about hellfire and brimstone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I realize that everybody looks silly if put on camera at the wrong time. We shouldn't judge people because of documentaries. And I realize that not all of this stuff is bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad theology is the problem here. Kids talking about hellfire and brimstone is freaky because it highlights where theology has gone wrong.

When your job keeps you too stressed to function well when you are off?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a catch-22 situation. If you keep your stressful job, you won't be able to enjoy your life, but if you quit, you won't have enough money to enjoy your life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have just stepped down from the position of full-time instructor at Draughons Junior College, and have taken a new part-time role. This is not so much due to "having too much money from being a rock star", as it is due to "having too much to do as a musician to keep up this full-time job".&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the last couple of months, it has been pretty stressful, and I got to the point of utter mental exhaustion. That is saying a lot; I'm the one who never sleeps, who plays shows back-to-back-to-back and is happy about it, and who is always pressuring everyone to work, work, work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I realized I couldn't really fathom the thought of keeping up my teaching schedule and doing all this band stuff anymore. And that's good. After all, who doesn't want to be kept busy doing what they love?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So that just means I am going to have to trust that the money will come. And I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel so relaxed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-micah&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2004/06/12/redding-brothers-pack-the-house-at-borders-06112004/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2004/06/12/redding-brothers-pack-the-house-at-borders-06112004/</link><pubDate>Sat Jun 12 02:26:00 CDT 2004</pubDate><title>Redding Brothers pack the house at Borders - 06/11/2004</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>BARBOURSVILLE, WV - The Reddings kept the atmosphere relaxed and interactive, and the intimate setting made the listener feel a true connection with the band and with the songs....</description><content:encoded>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;BARBOURSVILLE, WV - The Reddings kept the atmosphere relaxed and interactive, and the intimate setting made the listener feel a true connection with the band and with the songs.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2008/09/28/a-christian-band/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2008/09/28/a-christian-band/</link><pubDate>Sun Sep 28 22:53:13 CDT 2008</pubDate><title>A Christian Band?</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>This weekend I was asked for the thousandth time if my band is a "Christian band".

In many people's minds, at least, this would mean that we only play songs that directly talk about a spiritual or religious subject. To most people, it would mean we were playing "Contemporary Christian Music", a genre that has less to do with Christian subject matter than with a particular sound that has broad appeal among the Christian market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neither of those things are true about us. We do not play CCM (Contemporary Christian Music), nor do I limit my songs to ones that have religious themes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My approach to music is from a different direction altogether. Rather than set out a genre that I want my music to fall into, I set out from the start to write music about things I &lt;em&gt;cared about&lt;/em&gt;. The things I think about and immerse myself in become the subjects and the inspiration for the songs I write.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than set out to write a song about the theological notion of God's grace, I write a song that arises suddenly and spontaneously from my experience of the utter depth of my &lt;a title="Unfaithful" href="http://www.reddingbrothers.com/music"&gt;faithlessness&lt;/a&gt; - and the recognition of God's presence even there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How could I say we're a Christian band? But how could I say we're not?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The issue is that we've divided the world up into the "Christian market" and the "secular market", into "the Christian subculture" and everything else. We have Christian movies, Christian music, Christian comedians, Christian television, Christian books, Christian bookstores, Christian colleges, etc, etc, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don't think Jesus intended things to be done this way. Jesus didn't intend to set up a subculture - an insular group creating content only for themselves. Instead, he intended to create a group that would go out into the world and draw from his example to &lt;em&gt;create&lt;/em&gt;, to transform the situations they found themselves in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than Christian movies, we should have Christians &lt;em&gt;embedded&lt;/em&gt; in Hollywood, involved in the making of movies, influencing them to be deeper, more artistic, more authentic. Rather than Christian musicians, we should have Christians involved in the creation of music at all levels, &lt;em&gt;embedded&lt;/em&gt; in the music culture, authentically expressing the human spirit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we shift from the idea of a Christian subculture to this idea of embedded Christianity, we will see something far more productive than simply an alternate version of whatever's popular in secular culture. Instead, we will see the rise of an entirely new level of cultural and creative development, as Christians everywhere begin to use their God-given creativity to transform &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of their lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we shift to this idea of embedded Christianity, we won't just see more songs written to be sung on Sunday mornings, we'll see songs written to cruise to, to climb mountains with, to sing to your friends and neighbors. We'll see music that addresses all of our God-given human emotions, that honors the depths of humanity created in the image of God.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And bearing the image of God in all that you do is definitely not a narrow genre.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2011/01/27/why-i-hate-business/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2011/01/27/why-i-hate-business/</link><pubDate>Thu Jan 27 22:10:17 CST 2011</pubDate><title>Why I hate business</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>I actually love enterprise.

I love the idea of individuals and small groups of people getting together and building something wonderful, and having that wonderful something produce prosperity for them and their community and the world at large.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But for some reason, I get really annoyed by people who are "really into business", who are obsessed with the topic, who want to write about it, and talk about their aspirations as business owners, etc, etc, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And I just figured out what that reason is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who are into music, technology, house-building, cabinetry, automotive engineering, writing, astronautics, philosophy, pizza-making, ditch-digging, and grammar-correcting-for-hire really interest me. They interest me even if I'm not into the thing they're into. If they're making a lot of money with their pizza-making or whatever, I really respect that. If they want to share their strategy for turning their mom-and-pop pizza joint into a multi-national aunt-and-uncle pizza joint, I'm probably interested in reading about that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What they are doing with their specific focus is telling me how they are &lt;em&gt;making the world a better place&lt;/em&gt;. Maybe just by improving the pizza slice that you eat on your way home from the dentist, or making a deeper ditch, or writing a better poem...but these people are contributing something that they value to the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Someone who is obsessed with business, on the other hand, is telling me how excited they are to extract value from the world. Which is cool - I want them to find good ways to provide value and extract payment for that value. But I'm more interested in hearing about the way they're going to provide value - not the way they're going to extract value. One excites and interests me - the other strikes me as boring and selfish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's some irony in this. &lt;em&gt;I'm&lt;/em&gt; being selfish in that I want to hear about how people are going to create something that will make the world, and by extension my own life, better. I'm not interested in how they're going to make &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; life better.

We took as our text the entire story of scripture, and looked at it through the lens of a God who creates us for partnership, and continually calls us back into partnership with him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story, when told this way, is simple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;God is revealed as a God who creates and cultivates life, who calls life forth, and takes joy in its appearance. As the culmination of his creative process, he creates a being like himself, and commissions this being to do the same work he does: to create and cultivate life, to name and categorize creation, to fill the world and bring it peace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This being is called humanity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From its first moments, humanity will partner in the work of God. This is God’s magnificent intention, the thing which brings God ultimate delight — not simply to have created, but to have created a being like himself, a partner and collaborator in the ongoing work of creation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If all goes as planned, humanity will spread out into the world, bringing beauty and joy and peace wherever it goes, creating new things, and bringing new life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But before long, humanity has broken the partnership, and the world as a whole spirals into violence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So God sets out to redeem the world, to rescue it from self-destruction. And he does this by seeking to partner with human beings to enact that redemption. If the problem with the world is that it has broken partnership with God, God will renew the world by renewing this partnership. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So God calls Noah to save the world by constructing a giant technological artifact. And in doing so, Noah partners with God, and fulfills the original human commission to cultivate life—rescuing not just human beings, but animal life as well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;God has worked redemption by renewing the partnership between God and humans. The Bible calls that partnership “covenant”, and it comes up again and again in the Biblical story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When humans break partnership, God sets out to redeem them by renewing that partnership—with groups, nations, individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But ultimately, every attempt at partnership is broken. And so finally, God sends his Son.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jesus Christ is the ultimate partnership between God and humanity. In his body, he is the organic unity of the human and the divine. He himself is the &lt;em&gt;New Covenant&lt;/em&gt;, the new agreement which reconciles God and humanity, sealing the partnership permanently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As such, he is the ultimate human. All the intentions and aspirations of God for the human race are finally culminated in him. He does not exercise the rights and authority of God (Philippians 2:6), but the possibility and potential of humanity living up to its true nature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that is vast indeed. God had given humanity charge of all creation (Genesis 1, Psalm 8), and yet, according to the author of Hebrews, humanity had still only glimpsed a small part of what they had been given charge over—which even included the world to come (Hebrews 2:5-8). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And because Christ was in full partnership with God, everything that humans had inherited went to him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;If that was all there was to the story, the rest of us might be out of luck. Until Christ, humanity had been unable to maintain partnership with God. And though Christ had achieved this perfect partnership and unity, things still did not bode well for the rest of the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Except for this: Christ calls us into organic union with him. As the most intimate partnership between God and humanity, Christ himself seeks partnership—and strives to become intimately connected with all the rest of us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And so Christ calls us to become part of his body, and seeks to become part of our bodies. He invites his disciples to “eat his flesh” and “drink his blood”, to consume the New Covenant, to “partake of his body”. We become what we eat, so to speak, and in partaking of Christ, we become organically transformed into him (2 Corinthians 3:18; Colossians 1:27).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Paul and others see it, this means that we are now part of Christ, participating in the divine nature (2 Peter 1:3-4), sharing his suffering, enacting his works, partaking of his glory. We follow Christ’s trajectory of suffering and glorification, of weakness and of reigning (2 Timothy 2:11-12).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Christ’s body, we share in the work of Christ, which is the work of partnership that God originally intended for humanity (Ephesians 2:10). We create and cultivate life, we explore and categorize creation, we bring healing and renewal and life to the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most provocatively, there’s nothing in Christ’s world-transforming work that we are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; called to participate in. We are involved at every step of the way, from healing the sick and feeding the hungry (Matthew 10:8; Matthew 25:34–36) — through much greater works to come (John 14:12). We reign with Christ as he defeats all enemies including death (1 Corinthians 15:25–27; Hebrews 2:5–8; Revelation 2:26–27; 5:10; 20:4–6), even judging the world and raising the dead (1 Corinthians 6:2–3; Matthew 10:8).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Genesis 1, God is pictured as engaging in six days of solo creation. That work culminates with the creation of humanity—a being intended to partner in God’s creative work. And then, on the seventh day, God rests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Going forward, humanity was supposed to join with God, beginning a whole new act of creation that would flow forth from the partnership between God and humanity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But with the partnership between God and humans broken, the creative work came to a halt. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, Christ restores the partnership. And so early Christians identify Christ’s resurrection as occurring on the “eighth day” of the week, the day after the seventh day, the day that new creation begins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This new creation is not a scrapping of the old creation, it is a continuation of it—a new addition emerging from the joyful partnership between God and humanity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And so, at the ultimate edge of the Biblical vision, we are seen as moving forward in partnership with God, continuing the work of creation, participating in the renewal of the entire cosmos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Spirit himself testifies with our spirit that we are God’s children. Now if we are children, then we are heirs—heirs of God and co-heirs with Christ, if indeed we share in his sufferings in order that we may also share in his glory.&lt;br/&gt;I consider that our present sufferings are not worth comparing with the glory that will be revealed in us. For the creation waits in eager expectation for the children of God to be revealed. For the creation was subjected to frustration, not by its own choice, but by the will of the one who subjected it, in hope that the creation itself will be liberated from its bondage to decay and brought into the freedom and glory of the children of God. (Romans 8:16-21)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the relationship between God and humanity renewed, humanity is restored to its original mission. And all creation delights in anticipation of the glorious, generative reign of humanity in partnership with God.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2007/05/23/the-physics-of-immortality/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2007/05/23/the-physics-of-immortality/</link><pubDate>Wed May 23 01:41:00 CDT 2007</pubDate><title>The Physics of Immortality</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>When I was about 13, I read a book called "The Physics of Immortality".

Now, 12 years later, the author (Frank Tipler), has released a sequel called "The Physics of Christianity". I recently bought it and read it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me attempt to explain his theory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;1) In the beginning&lt;/span&gt;, the universe began with a big bang. Billions of years later, mankind exists. In the near future, mankind will spread outward from earth, propagating across the universe, until it is full of intelligent life. Eventually the universe will begin to contract, and intelligent life will guide the contraction of the universe so that life can continue to exist at higher and higher levels of energy, possessing more and more power and control over the universe, gaining more and more knowledge, and thinking faster and faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Approaching the final big crunch, the natural thought processes of life speed up to infinity, the amount of knowledge and information stored goes to infinity, and the amount of available energy goes to infinity. Life will have an infinite number of experiences and thoughts before the final big crunch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;2) The universe began and ends with a Singularity of infinite knowledge&lt;/span&gt;, power, and life. This Singularity is outside of both space and time, yet gives rise to all of space and time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Singularity created reality, life, and the laws of physics, and draws all of reality into it. Specifically, this Singularity is what forces life to begin and to spread out from earth, and to ultimately unite with it. This Singularity has the power to resurrect us all and to grant us eternal life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Singularity is required to exist by the laws of physics, but the laws of physics do not and &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;cannot&lt;/span&gt; apply to it: physical laws cannot deal with a literal infinity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Singularity is in the future (our ultimate Final Cause and Destination), the past (our ultimate First Cause), and the present (more on that later).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;3) The universe is actually a multiverse&lt;/span&gt; of an infinite number of parallel histories, wherein different versions of ourselves do slightly different things, make different choices, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(This I ABSOLUTELY agree with. This one thing solves the problem of free will and the problem of evil in one fell swoop, while NO ONE ELSE has ever solved these problems.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All histories began and end in the same Singularity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;4) We might as well go ahead and call the Singularity, "God"&lt;/span&gt;. In fact, Frank Tipler goes ahead a calls it a Triune God, consisting of One Singularity which is also Three Singularities: Ultimate Past, Ultimate Present, Ultimate Future. Or, God the Spirit, God the Son, God the Father, respectively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;5) Jesus was necessary:&lt;/span&gt; in order for mankind to begin its outward spread to unite with God, Jesus had to live, die, and be raised again. Since the Singularity controls all of reality for Its ultimate goals, the Singularity caused Jesus to rise again so that mankind could one day be united with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More to come...&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/all-things-work-together-for-good/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/all-things-work-together-for-good/</link><pubDate>Tue Feb 23 09:51:52 CST 2016</pubDate><title>All Things Work Together For Good</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>There’s a verse in Romans that says something like this: “All things work together for good”.

He thought it was saying that all things are already good—we just can’t see it yet. And, rightly I think, he was offended by that idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was offended because it is obvious that the world around us is not one where &lt;em&gt;all things&lt;/em&gt; are good. There is suffering, there is pain, there are horrors too unspeakable to want to mention here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To say that all these horrors have a purpose, have some kind of benevolent reason behind them, seems wrong. In fact, it seems like a way of deadening yourself to the world, convincing yourself to turn away from the reality in front of you, and live in a sort of denial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is something that Christian thinkers have criticized in many forms of Eastern spirituality. Many times it seems like those forms of spirituality are simply trying to convince us that suffering doesn’t matter—that we should learn not to care about it, or that it’s an illusion, or that it would go away if we stopped desiring &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to suffer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are branches of Christianity which do the same thing. Every time a tornado strikes a town, or an earthquake demolishes a village, there are people who will come out of the woodwork and declare this an act of God. In claiming that this event was all part of God’s plan, they convince themselves that there is nothing unjust happening, that they can safely turn their eyes away, and pretend that suffering never happens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even very sophisticated thinkers, who don’t resort to blaming the victims for their presumed sins, still often attribute some purpose or reason to the event. During a recent disaster, a well-known theologian tweeted something about God’s plan at work. On seeing the backlash from that statement, he replied that he had just intended to offer comfort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is telling. For him, this belief allows him to disengage from the suffering around him, convinced that it is &lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt; good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, this is not what the verse says. “All things work together for good” is not a declaration that things are okay. It is a declaration that &lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/2013/04/21/better-apocalypse"&gt;the arc of the universe is long, but it bends towards justice&lt;/a&gt;. It is a declaration that all the chaos and disaster and destruction of life become the raw material for new good things which will emerge. It is a declaration that life itself is always in the process of overcoming evil with good, of picking up the pieces and building something even better, of adapting to new situations and circumstances to keep things moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some ways, it is a statement of &lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/2015/12/31/what-i-would-write"&gt;infinite play&lt;/a&gt;. The world is not pre-planned, but something we will engage with and adapt to. Every setback will be met with greater creativity, every destruction will be met with greater creation, every suffering will be met with greater compassion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is what we see in nature: every living thing, always growing and changing and adapting, not stopping for a second when things go wrong. Instead, life rushes in to fill the space, to use the raw materials of that destruction as seeds for the next generation, the next growth, the next forest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, it’s possible that the Calvinists and the Buddhists are right in their approach to suffering. It’s possible that all of this is pre-planned. There’s no way to disprove something like that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But to me, the distinctively Christian notion seems to be that God is working in and through life, constantly meeting evil with compassion, constantly meeting destruction with growth and creation, constantly meeting death with resurrection—working all things together for good.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2004/12/21/you-have-a-postcard-from-micah-redding/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2004/12/21/you-have-a-postcard-from-micah-redding/</link><pubDate>Tue Dec 21 08:37:00 CST 2004</pubDate><title>You have a postcard from Micah Redding</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>Your friend Micah Redding has sent you a postcard from the Jones Soda Photo Gallery site which you can pick up at

From the moment human consciousness sprang into being, it has been trying to remake the world in its image. Consciousness is, after all, fundamentally a virtual reality, a space that exists where no space really is, where echoes and phantoms of reality may live out entirely new existences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first human consciousness looked out on the world, and began to absorb it. The mind quickly became inhabited by kingdoms and peoples and imaginary histories, and timelines of might-have-been versions of things it saw. The world colonized the mind, and then the mind expanded and began to colonize the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Writing was the first attempt to colonize reality. It took one mind's creations, and created a space where they could live permanently, or launch themselves into the minds of others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, music was allowing emotions to abstract themselves from one person, and begin to live in the spaces around and between societies. Folk songs became cultural reservoirs which thousands upon thousands of people poured themselves into, and in doing so, gave part of themselves to immortality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then there was acting and playwriting. The created worlds of the mind were beginning to emerge in a concrete form, temporarily possessing individuals to make their presence felt. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent times, photography, and then cinema, began to allow the virtual worlds to take on definition, broadcasting high-resolution versions of what humanity had previously only intuited. But realism is only one dimension of the advance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another is mobility. From radio to television to telephones to personal computers to iPhones and tablets, the virtual world has been making strong in-roads on our lives. And it's getting stronger; every day, our virtual devices become better at getting us to glance down. And every time we do, we are back in their virtual domain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world is being consumed and remade by the virtual. Every industry, every area of interest to humans, is rapidly becoming an exercise in software design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bricks and mortar of this new world are software and communication. The functionality that is being built today will be the foundation of new worlds to come. The communication protocols will hold it all together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the most important thing being built isn't the code itself. The code will be replaced over time. The most important things currently emerging are principles, standards, and best practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I was young, I got the chance to walk through a petrified forest. The trees were fallen and cracked open, and I got to inspect the amazing insides of trees that had been totally replaced with stone. Particle by particle, everything inside the tree had leaked out, and minerals had been pulled in to replace it, in such a way that the stone was a perfect replica of the tree, bark and tree-rings and all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Software is like that in a lot of ways. Pieces of it are removed and replaced over time, until eventually nothing of the original is left. What remains are the processes, the embedded ideology or intelligence that the developers encoded. The way each piece of code fit together, the way it interacts within itself and then with the outside world, emerges from a set of principles that the developers were operating by.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Occasionally the original principles were poorly conceived, and the entire software project has to be rewritten. This is usually painful, a pulling out of deeply rooted connections. Other times, the principles are so good that the original backbone of software may remain unchanged for a long, long time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If someone wants to build long-lasting code, they may consciously choose to use the best, most expansive principles they can. And if someone discovers a useful enough principle, their creation may become embedded in the world forever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These principles and best practices are rapidly evolving. But they are the deep structures of the world that will soon exist. Layer upon layer of software will echo their curvature, shaping the landscape of the coming reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are building ourselves a virtual universe. Developers are the architects, the powerful mages that lay the foundations. But the world must also be filled, and every form of art and culture and expression is being called upon to fill it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the virtual world expands, it becomes a vacuum, sucking up any creation it comes into contact with. This is why social media has exploded - there is simply so much space that needs to be filled, almost any kind of content will do. But all other kinds of media are being pulled in too. And as they are pulled in, they are released from the constraints they operated under before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is why books and music and television and movies and photographs are all rapidly converging. They don't fit together well, having started on opposite ends of the virtual universe, but as they are pulled out into the open (from the point of view of software), they are heading into each others' territory very quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Artists should stop thinking of themselves as workers in a particular medium. They should see themselves as fillers of virtual realities, and ones who will do so with any tool that comes to hand. We are not painters or writers or musicians. We are creators of worlds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, we must think carefully about our medium. Media of all sorts are growing insignificant as they become just another part of the vast expanse of world-creation. Perhaps it is time to take up more powerful tools. Perhaps it is time to re-orient the way our tools speak into the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the virtual world expands, I expect that people who tell facts will become less significant. Increasingly, we will simply be able to watch the facts we care about, as they happen. But those who create stories and who build meaning will be more important than ever. They will give us the directions to navigate by, and the blueprints for our future.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/03/06/why-are-humans-evil/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/03/06/why-are-humans-evil/</link><pubDate>Tue Mar 06 11:37:32 CST 2012</pubDate><title>Why are humans Evil?</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>Some comments on a [recent post](http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/02/29/morality-rational-and-how-we-shape-meaning-void) brought up the question of why humans are moral.

Is it because there is a God, or did we just evolve to act this way?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intriguing as that question is, I'm more interested in a different question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why are humans &lt;em&gt;evil&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This may seem like a strange question at first. After all, many people talk about nature &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Memoriam_A.H.H.#Nature.2C_Red_in_Tooth_and_Claw"&gt;“red in tooth and claw”&lt;/a&gt;, as if nature were this vast landscape of total war - every creature against every creature - always violence, always death, always brutality. In this landscape, humanity is a bright spot of unnatural goodness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that doesn't really seem to be the way things are. Nature is composed of vast cooperative enterprises, from coral reefs to forests to flocks of birds and schools of fish. Multi-celled creatures organize themselves into ecosystems and symbiotic relationships, bees and flowering plants maintaining each other's existence, bacteria supporting ever more complex life-forms, scavengers and predators working to turn dead animals back into usable food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The points of contact at which any violence may occur are relatively few. Two different animals fighting over a meal, one animal trying to eat - another animal trying not to be eaten, two animals battling it out for a mate. Even then, we sometimes find the violence to be less than we assumed - predators are often only picking off the already dying, and battles for mating privileges are usually resolved by establishing who is stronger, leaving both combatants relatively unharmed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the animal world, there is no vengeance, no war, no genocide. Animals act to achieve their needs, but they go no further. They do not hold grudges, they do not maintain feuds, they do not even seek to wipe out their competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But humans are different. We hold deep grudges, and nourish deep anger. We plot to destroy, we conspire to kill, we organize to go to war. We wipe out whole races of people, and enslave millions. We do what could not even be conceived of by looking at the natural world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How did we get this way?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think it starts with &lt;em&gt;death&lt;/em&gt;. As far as we know, we are the only creatures with a deep and abiding sense of our own mortality - not just as a future event, but as a reality which haunts us, which lives with us, which steals a little of our identity every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genesis describes this dynamic. The first human beings, naive and uncorrupted, reached out and took for themselves &lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/03/06/death-and-knowledge-good-and-evil"&gt;the knowledge of the gods&lt;/a&gt;. And once they had tasted it, they recoiled in terror. The knowledge of their own mortality sunk deep into them, changing who they were, filling them with fear and shame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a way non-existent anywhere else, we human beings know that we are dying. And we fear. Our fear possesses us, our fear makes us pursue our own self-interest, our fear makes us a slave to anyone who threatens us. This fear is deep, present in everything from militaristic nation-building to consumer advertising. Everywhere, voices threaten us with our own mortality, wielding our deaths as a weapon of control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But from the moment the first warlord rose up and enslaved another people, we have seen only one escape from our terror: to possess and wield violence ourselves. If others can control our very souls, our only protection is to acquire the power they use to do so. If our fear makes us a slave to tyranny, we will be filled with a hatred for that which controls us, and a lust to possess that power ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the truly Satanic impulse, to hate something and to lust for it at the same time. The more we hate the violence inflicted on us, the more we long to exercise that violence. It is a never-ending dynamic, drawing us ever deeper in the bottomless pit of a dark worship. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And so humanity emerged from the ancient mists as a creature of war and violence and slavery. We went out to destroy all those who might threaten us, preemptively seeking to decimate the world. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is how we became evil.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/the-tree-of-the-knowledge-of-good-and-evil/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/the-tree-of-the-knowledge-of-good-and-evil/</link><pubDate>Sat Apr 02 11:44:11 CDT 2016</pubDate><title>The Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>Curiously, Genesis attributes the downfall of humanity to something identified only as *The Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil*.

This mysterious tree is the one thing in all of creation forbidden to humans, and yet it is growing at the center of the garden of Eden—and in some ways, at the center of the biblical story. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is this story even talking about?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s step back. There are actually two trees in the story, the first of which is the Tree of Life, and the second of which is the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What should be immediately obvious is that these are the twin attributes of divinity. Any deity worth its salt is primarily distinguished by these two factors: immortality, and the knowledge of things beyond understanding. These trees weren’t &lt;em&gt;The Tree of Life&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Tree of Death&lt;/em&gt;, as if they represented a good and an evil choice. Rather, they were the Tree of Life and the Tree of Knowledge—two good things, two characteristics of God.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;God had already made his intentions clear. Humanity was created to &lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/04/28/image-god"&gt;be like God&lt;/a&gt;, to do the sort of work that God does: to create and cultivate life, to name and categorize creation. And so these two trees were not hidden away from humankind—but planted directly within reach. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And yet, God forbids humans to eat from the Tree of Knowledge. Why?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people have imagined God playing some kind of elaborate trick here. Perhaps God is forbidding something, just so humans will have the option to disobey him. Maybe God &lt;em&gt;wants&lt;/em&gt; humans to experience pain and evil, just so he can teach us a lesson. Maybe this is why he forbids something, and then puts it tauntingly within reach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think the answer is simpler and much more straight-forward. And not nearly so insulting to God.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Humans weren’t ready.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We must picture the first humans as children—if not physically, then mentally or emotionally. In comparison to our own jaded outlook, they were innocent and uncomplicated. They were not ready for the weight and responsibility of all the knowledge that was available. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We routinely play out this exact scenario with children. We protect them from knowledge until we deem them ready to handle it. We tell them not to go places or do certain things, or even read about certain subjects, until they’re older. We understand that it takes time for people to process certain information, to grow into a mentality large enough and stable enough to grapple with some of the more difficult aspects of life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When this protective boundary is breached too early, it can lead to lasting trauma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think this is what Genesis is telling us about human beings. Humanity is a species that grew up too soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Humans were made in the &lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/the-structure-of-the-biblical-story"&gt;image of God&lt;/a&gt;. We were intended to participate in both the life and the knowledge of God. Apparently, we were intended to have the &lt;em&gt;life&lt;/em&gt; first, so that we could grow into our ability to handle the knowledge. But we took the knowledge first, and became intensely traumatized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We took possession of the knowledge of God before we took possession of the life of God, and we have been experiencing the consequences ever since.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We could not give back the knowledge. We could not unsee what we had seen. And so humanity emerged into the world as a creature before its time: a creature with godlike knowledge and power, a creature which could control nature and reshape the world—but a creature struggling under the weight of that responsibility, traumatized and weighed down with a sense of shame and brokenness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Genesis account, God sees the trauma humans have undergone, and decides we aren’t ready to grapple with the responsibility of immortality as well. So he sends humans out of the garden, and locks that aspect of divinity away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the story has it, we cannot go back, we can only go forward. And so God sets out, not to take us back to Eden, but to help us grow to the point where we can handle the knowledge we have been given. Only then, will we be able to possess both the knowledge &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; the life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that’s &lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/03/06/why-are-humans-evil"&gt;another story&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/wireheading-faith-healing-and-the-placebo-effect/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/wireheading-faith-healing-and-the-placebo-effect/</link><pubDate>Wed Mar 01 10:35:05 CST 2017</pubDate><title>Wireheading, Faith Healing, and Why the Placebo Effect is the Most Important Thing in the World</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>If you could flip a switch and experience more pleasure than you have ever felt in your entire life—would you do it?

What if it made you feel contented and successful and accomplished and creative? What if that switch made you feel &lt;em&gt;loved&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It would be hard to resist flipping that switch, almost by definition. We’re wired to seek pleasure—Just think about how hard it is to turn down your favorite mouth-watering snack. Of course, we work hard to balance our pleasure-seeking with other forms of satisfaction. Diet promoters try to sell us on the good feelings of accomplishment, victory, or impressing our peers. But what if all of those feelings were available at the flip of a switch as well? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Could we resist flipping it on?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe more importantly, once we had turned that switch on, would we ever turn it off?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is what we might call the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wireheading Problem&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, and it’s the kind of question that keeps futurist types up at night. We already know that a wire implanted in the brain can trigger intense feelings of happiness, pleasure, even spirituality. These days, it doesn’t even need to be a wire—you can just put on a helmet, and experience a feeling of oneness with everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eventually, this technology is going to make it to kiosks at your local mall—and then the privacy of your own home. As that technology gets better, more pervasive, and ever more precise, what’s to keep us all from vanishing into a world of exquisite happiness? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How long will future generations be able to avoid the temptation to simply short-circuit their brains—and in so doing, bring about the end of the human race?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Actually, of course, we already struggle with the beginning stages of this problem today. I recently read the novel &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://amzn.to/2lUg5JR"&gt;Fiend&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, about a zombie apocalypse where the only survivors are meth addicts. The book is written first-person, and over and over the main character describes the feeling of shooting up, in incredibly poetic and beautiful prose. As I progressed through the book, it occurred to me that the author was writing from experience—and sure enough, when I looked him up, I discovered that the author was a former meth addict himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What I heard in his prose was a sadness and a longing for this experience that he could no longer allow himself to have. Even knowing that this experience was producing deep ugliness in himself and the world around him, for him, the experience itself was an experience of deep beauty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve tasted that, how do you walk away?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a problem for drug addicts today, but it will be incredibly more problematic in the future. Wireheading promises (threatens?) to be able to deliver everything that is delivered by drugs, but to remove any sense of remorse or guilt or regret that goes along with it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you think deeply about that, I believe you’ll realize there’s no foolproof way out. You can avoid going down that road, but once you’re there, how do you escape? And how do you stay strong enough to never dip your toe into those waters? How do you live an entire lifetime, and not have a moment of weakness where you are inclined to kickstart that feedback loop to immeasurable bliss?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Right now, we are constrained by a number of factors. Drugs are actually kind of difficult to use, don’t produce reliable results, and come with all kinds of negative feelings. Wireheading promises to remove all the negative side effects, produce dramatically more results than any drug has done to date, and make good feelings as easy as flipping a switch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assuming we want to avoid humanity going down in a blaze of blissful addiction, what is the solution?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think there’s only one answer: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;We have to let someone else control the switch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By definition, we’ll be unable to make good self-control decisions from the inside. Everything you might use to resist the urge toward switched-on happiness will itself become the engine of your downfall. Desire self-control? You can &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; like you’re exercising self-control with a simple flip of the switch. Desire the well-being of others? You can &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; like you’ve insured their well-being with the simple flip of a switch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So if nothing internal will work, then we need something external. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You might say, well, we should just permanently ban this technology. But that’s easier said than done. Most strong drugs are illegal, and yet we still produce them for their helpful medical uses. We’re not willing to give them up completely, and for good reason—used properly these drugs can do a lot of good, and relieve a lot of unnecessary suffering. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same will be true for the technologies that will enable wireheading. There will be many good uses for them, that society will not want to abandon. And so we will need to find a way of moving some control over these technologies from the individual to external society. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our approach to drugs illustrates one way of handling this. We allow them to be dispensed only by qualified medical professionals, who determine the correct dosages and timing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there are other possibilities. Perhaps we will want to give our families, our churches, our communities some kind of “override”—the ability to jump in and break us out of a runaway bliss process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps our fate will hang on what kinds of groups we give this to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in some way or form, it is clear to me that we will need to have a “switch” located on the &lt;em&gt;outside&lt;/em&gt;—where we ourselves can’t reach it. Some amount of pleasure, and some amount of pain, need to be permanently outside of our own control, or we are doomed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I find it interesting, then, that this seems to be what Mother Nature herself has done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, I’ve been doing a lot of thinking and reading about the placebo effect. We tend to think “placebo effect” means something isn’t really working—but that’s completely backwards. The placebo effect actually means something &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; working, when we expected it &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The typical example is sugar pills. A doctor gives a patient sugar pills, and the patient, thinking they’re medicinal, gets better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this example, we recognize that it isn’t the pills that have healed the patient—it’s something inside of them. Perhaps it’s their desire to get well, or their belief that they have a cure, or their trust in the doctor. Somehow, they’ve tapped into some latent healing potential by virtue of this placebo treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Religious people have a term for this. We call it “faith healing”. And it shows up on almost every medical study in history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the placebo effect can get even more bizarre. Sometimes, the patient &lt;em&gt;knows&lt;/em&gt; they are being given sugar pills, and still gets better. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The placebo effect has a dark side too: its inverse, the &lt;em&gt;nocebo&lt;/em&gt; effect. Instead of getting sugar pills intended as medicine, these patients are given sugar pills intended as poison. And they get worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Religious people have a term for this too. It’s called a &lt;em&gt;curse&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lest you think I’m leading you into a whole world of superstition here, let me point out that I’m not saying that dark spirits are emerging from the forest to enact curses on the unsuspecting population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m saying that we have a medically demonstrated phenomenon, where individuals seem to heal or poison themselves, by virtue of externally-issued commands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;It seems likely that the human brain is capable of vastly more than we see on a regular basis. Flow states and extreme situations bring out capabilities we didn’t know we had; near-death experiences demonstrate a broader range of mental states than we normally encounter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Physicist David Deutsch tells us that the human brain is &lt;em&gt;universal&lt;/em&gt;—that it is physically capable of solving any kind of problem that can be solved in our universe, that it can run any algorithm that can be described, that it can figure out how to construct anything that can be constructed. This doesn’t mean that any given person can do all those things &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt;, but it does mean that given enough time and desire, &lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/how-self-help-really-works"&gt;any finite project is achievable&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More to our point, it means that the human brain can take on any configuration—and that everything in human experience is a small part of what our brains can do. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the things we know that the brain &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; do, is manufacture powerful drugs. This drug-production capability is needed on a regular basis, as the brain wakes us up, puts us to sleep, heightens our alertness, calms us down, punishes us when we mess up, and rewards us for a job well done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many synthetic drugs work by simply hijacking the brain’s drug-production system, and getting it to spit out drugs when it wouldn’t otherwise do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This indicates something counter-intuitive to many people: the brain is constantly controlling and suppressing many of its own capabilities. Just because the brain &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; do something, doesn’t mean that capability is under our conscious control. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, that capability may be specifically denied to our conscious minds. Most of us can’t simply &lt;em&gt;choose&lt;/em&gt; to put ourselves into a psychedelic trance, or to move from sadness to extreme euphoria. These are clearly things our brains are capable of, and yet these are things that take a lot of work, or external stimuli, to accomplish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reason for that seems fairly straight-forward: the brain needs ways of correlating good internal states with good external states. &lt;strong&gt;Put another way, if it’s going to survive for very long, the brain needs to make us work for our rewards. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The simplest example is eating. For most people, eating is incredibly pleasurable, and for good reason: it’s historically a good survival mechanism. If you eat, your brain knows it can survive for another day, and it rewards you by turning on your pleasure centers briefly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your conscious mind were able to simply turn on those pleasure centers at will, you might lose all interest in eating, and eventually, your brain would die. Since it doesn’t want to die, your brain has a lot of interest in keeping a tight grip on who gets to turn on the pleasure centers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like a doctor with a locked medicine cabinet, your brain tightly controls who gets to dispense its drugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;With all of its immense powers and abilities, with all of its profound capability for self-modification and reprogramming, it seems likely that the brain long ago faced a wireheading problem of its own. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It would have addressed that in a variety of ways, almost as diverse as the brain itself—establishing tight internal controls, checks and balances, separation of powers, and so on. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But ultimately, it needed a fail-safe switch. And the only way to get it was to put a switch &lt;em&gt;on the outside&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This switch would serve a particular function. While many drugs and resources were available to different systems in the brain, some amount of them would be locked up and unavailable. Thus, the internal systems would be prevented from overclocking things in normal situations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in extreme cases, they might need more juice, and they would have to appeal for access to the emergency reserves. And they would be denied. &lt;em&gt;Unless the external switch was engaged&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This external switch was the ultimate defense against self-addiction. It would need to be placed within the larger community—most likely in the hands of trusted members who had good insight into whether the individual was spiraling into self-destruction, or working towards being productive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If these trusted external voices “signed off” on the request, the brain could then unlock its resources, and get to work. If they did not sign off on it, the brain would keep the extra resources locked up. And if things had already gone too far, these trusted external voices could signal the execution of emergency punitive measures to curtail runaway processes, and bring things back into line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Humans are social creatures, and for most of our history, our survival has hinged on nothing so much as our local tribe or community. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One way to think about that is to look at how much of our behavior and feelings of well-being are mediated through other people. Self-esteem, pride, honor, dignity, trust, morality, truth—all of these are things we experience to some degree through the eyes of others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I don’t think it’s much of an exaggeration to say that happiness is a social project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And this makes sense. To survive, we needed to get good at living in communities. We needed to develop deep internal systems of coordination and cooperation. We needed to measure ourselves by how well the community was doing, and how much we were contributing to the community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This meant putting lots of influence over our internal states into the hands of others. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m suggesting that this influence extends even to life and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ancient blessings and curses weren’t superstitious nonsense—they were social signals that kept a well-regulated society. And they most likely had powerful effects, potentially enabling vast capabilities within individuals, or dramatically shutting them down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The placebo effect may just be the tip of the iceberg.&lt;/strong&gt; But it’s notable that when we see it, it’s typically associated with people our society looks to as authority figures (doctors) and mechanisms our society ascribes immense symbolic power to (pills and medicines).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In our rapidly changing society, trust and social power are distributed much differently than they were in the world of our ancestors. Perhaps we haven’t yet figured out where we left the “keys” so to speak. Perhaps we do not yet know who can wield that power most effectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But maybe instead of working around things like the placebo effect, the society of the future should be looking for ways to amplify it as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2011/10/02/christianity-against-religion/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2011/10/02/christianity-against-religion/</link><pubDate>Sun Oct 02 23:10:51 CDT 2011</pubDate><title>Christianity against religion</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>Recently, I've had renewed interest in presenting a viewpoint I worked years and years to realize.

When I was working on understanding it, I assumed that once I finished researching, I would be able to explain it to the world. But as is often the case, once I had finished, I had ventured so far from where I began, I wondered if it was even worth the time. I had, after all, changed in the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm talking about my understanding the message of Jesus as the rejection of organized religion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was my first truly revolutionary understanding - the insight that changed the way I thought about myself and my world. I reached it by following the lines of argument that the Church of Christ (my "birth" religion) had laid out - but unlike most others, I followed those arguments to their natural conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, I just want to sketch out what that looks like, and lay out a map of where I'm going with this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/2007/01/15/who-is-god-the-secret-of-the-new-covenant"&gt;God is spirit&lt;/a&gt;. Jesus and Paul seem to see this insight as the core realization of the New Testament, the fact that changes everything. Jesus uses it to reject temples, rituals, and other forms of worship, to disavow religious hierarchy of all kinds, and to declare all foods clean. Paul uses it to reject circumcision, to proclaim the equality of women, slaves, Jew, and gentile, and to free all of his hearers from the bonds of the Law. The idea is simple: God is spirit, thus God does not care about external divisions or observances. God is spirit, thus the only thing God cares about is our spiritual state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;No barriers to God. Building on the previous insight, Jesus' entire career can be seen as an attempt to free access to God from the constraints of religion, priesthood, and ritual. Access to God is available to everyone, everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Universal brotherhood of man. Though phrased as classic humanism, this is a core idea of the New Testament, that all humanity is equal and created in the image of God. This was Paul's first sermon to the gentile world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/2011/10/30/how-1-corinthians-11-actually-statement-about-female-equality"&gt;Full equality of women&lt;/a&gt;. The bible makes four things very clear: that men and women were created to equally bear the image of God, that male dominance is a result of human brokenness, that full inclusion of women was a primary feature of the prophesied New Covenant, and that the first Christians scandalously included women as full equals in public settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shadows vs Truth. As the first Christians saw it, symbolic rituals were only shadows of the reality that was truly important - one's spiritual state. Thus, every ritual was to be removed in favor of real life and relationship. Where organized religion promoted actions that had no inherent value (sacrifices, washings, etc), Christians promoted loving one's neighbor, helping the poor, and protecting the innocent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Church" was the rich following Jesus' instructions, and inviting the poor, the lame, the blind, the slaves, and the Jews into their homes to party. They were used to inviting each other, but by inviting those outside of their social group, they created a scandalous testament of human equality to the ancient world. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Lord's Supper" was the rich sharing their food with the poor, eating together as equals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The "deacons" were those who volunteered to distribute food to the poor. The "bishops" were those who looked after the orphans and widows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was no Sunday morning church, no worship service, no religious rituals, no central church treasury, no hierarchy of religious leaders, no congregations, no denominations, no church names, no church signs, no preachers, no worship music. Nothing like an organized religion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people think it's okay to be spiritual without organized religion. Others think that Christianity originally had no organized religion. But I think that Christianity was actually the rejection of religion altogether - the embrace of God and relationship outside of any artificial constructions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are some of the basics, some of the things I want to &lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/2011/11/21/christianity-reborn"&gt;expand upon and demonstrate more fully&lt;/a&gt;. If you have any questions or feedback, I'd love to hear them.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2008/02/05/heres-to-politics/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2008/02/05/heres-to-politics/</link><pubDate>Tue Feb 05 23:18:00 CST 2008</pubDate><title>Here&amp;#039;s to Politics</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>Here's politics and the world in a few hundred words.Law is violence.

A "law" is just the statement, "do this or we will kill you". Tax law means "pay taxes or we will lock you up in jail, or shoot you, or destroy your family". Criminal law is "don't do bad things to other people, or we will lock you up in jail or shoot you, however we feel at the moment". Civil law is "pay those people the money you owe, or we'll send someone out to harass you, and if you don't listen to them, we'll send someone out to threaten you, and if you don't listen to them, we'll shoot you".&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The motives might be good, and we might defend the right of the law to use violence. But violence is what it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Government is the use of violence in a diplomatic and secretive way.&lt;br /&gt;Politics is the bitter struggle for the right to control the guns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you have something that is birthed in violence, it will return to violence. Thus, politics will never be clean, politicians will never be honest, and the government will never be effective. They're not designed to be. The government exists to maximize its ability to perform violence, not to suit some petty purpose you believe you've foisted on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of this, entanglement in politics leads to corruption. Look at the religious right and their multitude of scandals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But there's a better way. Politics doesn't have to rule. Let's consider other possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2007/06/11/what-is-identity/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2007/06/11/what-is-identity/</link><pubDate>Mon Jun 11 15:24:00 CDT 2007</pubDate><title>What is Identity?</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>"Bob isn't the man he used to be.""You aren't the same person I fell inlove with.""What happened to that little girl I used to hold on my knee?"Every day, we become a different person than we were the...</description><content:encoded>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"Bob isn't the man he used to be."&lt;br /&gt;"You aren't the same person I fell in&lt;br /&gt;love with."&lt;br /&gt;"What happened to that little girl I used to hold on my knee?"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every day, we become a different &lt;span style="FONT-STYLE: italic"&gt;person&lt;/span&gt; than we were the previous day. We acknowledge this all the time in common discussion. We say things like the above quotes all the time. In doing so, we are simply acknowledging that people change, and sometimes, the things that "make them who they are" change too. We don't keep the same friends forever, we don't stay in the same relationships. And the reason is because we (and our friends) are no longer the same people we used to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I pointed out in the last post, my perspective on &lt;a href="http://emergentchristian.blogspot.com/2007/05/problem-of-evil-part-1-unanswered.html"&gt;The Problem of Evil &lt;/a&gt;requires the acceptance of two premises:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Existence is better than non-Existence&lt;br /&gt;2) An individual is a collection of thoughts, feelings, experiences, and memories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've already addressed #1. But that seems to be self-evident to most people. What may not be as apparent is #2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I've stated in my article about The Problem of Evil is that my teenage self and my adult self are different people. And more important: the &lt;span style="FONT-STYLE: italic"&gt;me&lt;/span&gt; which had a painful experience, and the &lt;span style="FONT-STYLE: italic"&gt;me&lt;/span&gt; which did NOT have that painful experience are DIFFERENT PEOPLE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason this matters is because we often ask God, "why do you make me suffer?" But if I'm right, this question is almost meaningless. I can ask God why he let me wreck my bike and bust out my teeth. But the &lt;span style="FONT-STYLE: italic"&gt;me&lt;/span&gt; who's asking this question couldn't be anything other than what I am. The &lt;span style="FONT-STYLE: italic"&gt;me &lt;/span&gt;who asks why this event happened only exists &lt;span style="FONT-STYLE: italic"&gt;because&lt;/span&gt; this event happened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This makes perfect sense if we accept the already commonly understood notion that a person is a collection of thoughts, feelings, experiences, and memories. Without the experiences that we've had, we wouldn't be the same people we are now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But even though most people understand this, I've noticed that if you say that this is &lt;span style="FONT-STYLE: italic"&gt;really &lt;/span&gt;true, people have a problem with it. Some common responses I've heard are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you aren't the same person you were a few years ago, then how could the law hold you responsible for things you did in the past?"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Which &lt;span style="FONT-STYLE: italic"&gt;you&lt;/span&gt; gets to go to heaven?"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"If there are multiple versions of me in different universes, which one is the &lt;span style="FONT-STYLE: italic"&gt;real&lt;/span&gt; me?"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;I think all of these questions come from our discomfort with looking at how things really are. People have long been bothered by realizing that we are infinitesimal in comparison to the size of the universe. But there is really nothing bothersome in this; it's just different for some people. People have a similar reaction to realizing that we live in a practically infinite number of universes, wherein all possible histories are played out. It makes some people feel small and insignificant. But in reality, the impact of it is the opposite!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you realize that God created &lt;span style="FONT-STYLE: italic"&gt;every possible version&lt;/span&gt; of you, you realize not only how much he loves you, but how important it was to him that &lt;span style="FONT-STYLE: italic"&gt;this particular you&lt;/span&gt; would exist. This particular moment of your life, right now, was so significant to him that he created a whole universe just to house it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The issue of punishing people and so forth takes us to the issue of why do we judge or punish people in the first place? The answer is the same as the reason why we have friends - something we might call "Personality Inertia".&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See, even though people change every single moment, the changes happen a little at a time. So even though the &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt; you see tomorrow will be a different &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt; than the one you see now, it's likely that most of my personality traits are the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the same reasoning, if you tell me that you hate me, I will assume that you probably feel the same way 2 seconds later, even though I am dealing with a different "you". Across all the different versions of you, some things will tend to hold relatively consistent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the reason we punish or lock up killers - we assume that even if the murder was committed 2 years ago, the murderer probably still has enough of the same personality traits to be likely to murder again. Even though the person who committed the murder, and the person who gets locked up, are different people, the person who gets locked up probably still has the dangerous personality traits that caused the murder in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Choosing to lock up murderers is not a moral decision so much as it a practical decision - society wants to free from the reasonable fear of being killed. The best way to do this is to lock up people who are likely to murder - and the best way to find those people is to look at the ones whose &lt;em&gt;past versions&lt;/em&gt; committed murder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, society is not always right about this. It can't be, because it can't read minds. There are probably many murderers who would never murder again. And so it would make sense to think that an all-knowing judge would let these people go free. After all, if they're not going to murder again, it wouldn't do any good to lock them up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But society's courts have to base their rulings on what they DO know, not what they do not know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And yet, it is obvious that sometimes this is wrong. Someone who murdered 50 years ago, and is just now found out and convicted, may have become a pacifist in the meantime, and be horrified at the thought of killing. Various "statutes of limitations" try to deal with this issue. But society has a hard time telling the difference between a genuine change, and a change done just to get out of a sentence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But God would have no such limitation. God knows if a person who murdered 50 years ago is still inclined to murder or not. And God only judges based on what a person is really like&lt;em&gt; inside&lt;/em&gt;, not what was in their past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is why God tells us to "repent", or literally, to change. If we change, we are no longer the people who gave themselves to murder, theft, or hate. And God no longer holds us as guilty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-micah&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2008/03/17/going-public-with-my-ideas-2/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2008/03/17/going-public-with-my-ideas-2/</link><pubDate>Mon Mar 17 08:25:00 CDT 2008</pubDate><title>Going public with my ideas</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>I am a grand schemer; I devise plans not just for me, but for the world.

And a small part of those ideas get put into practice, and change things. But most of it goes undone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During the weekend in Atlanta, I attended the APCA conference, lived through a tornado, and set my mind on fire with ideas. Ideas that need DONE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And so in determining to DO things, I've decided that I need to go public with my intentions. I need ideas and help from others, and the ability to bounce my ideas off the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My aim is to do more with my band than just deliver a concert. I want to create an experience, and transcend what bands are "supposed" to do. I want to empower people to turn around and create their own world, rather than being content to consume the one created by what's left of MTV.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm taking baby-steps in that direction already. We're working on partnering with some organizations that are doing important things. We've worked with charities (like the Heifer Project) that we felt were doing something unique and creative in the world. We're moving into concerts that are more meaningful, and are more than just a show.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to make our concerts places where people build spontaneous community, not just an event people watch together. I want our concerts to empower and inspire people to go home and change their life. And I don't mean that in a touchy-feely way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some concerts leave you feeling like you want to quit your job and burn down your house. Not because they make you feel destructive, but because they inspire you with the vision of something bigger and much more amazing that YOU are capable of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to do that. I want to be that band. I want to inspire the next renaissance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's my soul. I want your feedback.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-micah&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/05/28/carrying-cash/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/05/28/carrying-cash/</link><pubDate>Mon May 28 13:54:00 CDT 2012</pubDate><title>Carrying Cash</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>*I'm in the middle of a 40-day, 16 stop, 14 country tour of the world.

The most annoying thing about this trip so far has been using currency.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carrying cash does not make me feel powerful. Carrying cash makes me feel vulnerable, like a target. Carrying cash makes me feel tied down, nervous about keeping track of what I've got on me. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Without&lt;/em&gt; cash, I can walk unafraid into bad neighborhoods and dark alleys. Without cash, I can approach strangers with open hands. Without cash, I have a ready and honest answer to all who ask for money. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;With&lt;/em&gt; cash, I am likely to spend more. With cash, I can negotiate for a low price, but must then face the awkwardness of asking for change. With cash, I am more likely to miscalculate, make rounding errors, or accidentally drop too much. With cash, I am always worrying about whether my bills are too large, too small, or too few. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With cash, I am a slave to the whims of paper, moisture, and rips and tears. &lt;em&gt;Without&lt;/em&gt; cash, I feel free. &lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2005/08/12/writers-showcase-edgehill-studios/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2005/08/12/writers-showcase-edgehill-studios/</link><pubDate>Fri Aug 12 01:34:00 CDT 2005</pubDate><title>Writers Showcase @ Edgehill Studios</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>As The Nashville Rage reported, I'm hosting a Writers Showcase at Edgehill Studios, just off of Music Row.

Many people on TV would suggest that Jesus came to teach us how to be happy. There is a lot of validity to that thought, but somehow it seems a little shallow. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other people suggest Jesus came to teach us how to be rich. Like Job's friends, they suggest that your riches (or lack thereof) are a measure of your spiritual success. Some people would frame Jesus as offering us an "out" from this life, with the promise of something much better after we die. Still others would say Jesus teaches us to suffer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To me, all of these ring hollow, or come off a bit masochistic. I would like to suggest another way of framing what Jesus teaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;History consists of kings and heroes. The kings amass power, conquer enemies, build kingdoms, and enslave their rivals. They usually die at the hands of their power-hungry family members, or manage to survive into old age by killing off those who are perceived as threats. Heroes, on the other hand, usually revel in life. They hold onto things lightly, and pass freely between the comforts of luxury and the open fields. They make tough decisions, they sacrifice, they suffer excruciating pain so that the life of their family, their people, or their world will be changed. Heroes change, and they change the world around them. Heroes usually die in rescuing others, or live to old age, surrounded by the people they sacrificed for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conventional thinking attributes the greatness of society and civilization to the acts of kings. But when we look a little deeper, almost every great change in history has come from lone figures, moving against the grain of their society, changing the world around them as they went. Kings rewrite history to take the credit, but they never originate change. Change is the poison of kings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Solomon can teach you to be a king, but he can't teach you to be a hero. And while the rest of the world might envy being Solomon, Jesus told his followers that someone even greater than Solomon was among them. Someone who could enact real change in the world, someone who reveled in life, who could make the difficult decisions and sacrifices necessary to reshape the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was a hero, and he taught them to be heroes.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2013/09/17/1379478440/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2013/09/17/1379478440/</link><pubDate>Tue Sep 17 23:27:20 CDT 2013</pubDate><title>1379478440</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>To speak tangentially, I think that suffering is an intrinsic part of being-hood.

Any being worth...uh...being, will experience suffering. We can respond to that suffering in a myriad of ways, including letting it fester and grow into vast, civilization-wide patterns of destruction. What Jesus advocates is that we refuse to support and promulgate such patterns. Instead, we must "swallow" the suffering, allowing it to be neutralized inside us, so that the world can survive and continue to grow. And that's exactly what Jesus does on the cross.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this is not masochism, it's heroism. There is no unnecessary suffering being created or advocated. In fact, the severity of what Jesus (and his followers) underwent was a direct result of the amount of suffering in the world that had already been directed into violence and destructiveness. Jesus forgives the violence directed against him precisely so that the violence can disappear from the world, instead of continuing to circulate in ever-more destructive ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a tough calling, and it's not surprising that sometimes this has been misread as a plea for self-destructiveness. That's why it's incredibly important to understand what Jesus does in light of the primacy of &lt;em&gt;life&lt;/em&gt; in the scriptures and in Jewish tradition. And it's also perhaps why Christianity has never spoken much about crucifixion without also talking about resurrection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/transfigurism/permalink/10153234528910436/?comment_id=10153239946780436&amp;offset=0&amp;total_comments=28"&gt;https://www.facebook.com/groups/transfigurism/permalink/10153234528910436/?comment_id=10153239946780436&amp;offset=0&amp;total_comments=28&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2006/11/15/whats-your-autism-quotient/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2006/11/15/whats-your-autism-quotient/</link><pubDate>Wed Nov 15 21:36:00 CST 2006</pubDate><title>What&amp;#039;s Your Autism Quotient?</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>I took this test to find my Autism Quotient, and I got a 10, which is below average. 11+ is average.

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;5 t-shirts. Various shades and textures of gray and black.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2 pairs of jeans. One for nicer settings, one for longer commutes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 belt.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 pair of general purpose shoes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;5 pairs of socks, one of which is black, the others white.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;5 pairs of underwear, black.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 pair of shorts, for sleeping in, or for swimming in.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 dark gray hoodie.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my closet, for when I'm not traveling, I want 3-5 button-up overshirts. Kind of architect-y, allowing me to travel freely into slightly more formal enviroments. For colder weather, I want a heavier coat to wear over my hoodie. In addition, I want one set of dress clothes and one pair of dress shoes, for those occassions that still demand such a thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As far as other devices, my list is fairly simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;iPhone, with wallet case, carrying ID and debit card.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hair-band keychain, holding 3 keys.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;11-inch Macbook Air, in bag with earphones, iPhone charger, and computer charger.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also have toiletries, a travel set and an at-home set. I'll spare you the details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that's pretty much it.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2014/12/20/spaceships-christmas/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2014/12/20/spaceships-christmas/</link><pubDate>Sat Dec 20 21:43:26 CST 2014</pubDate><title>Spaceships &amp; Christmas </title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>For some reason, I’ve always associated space exploration with Christmas.

I think it’s deeper, going back to something elemental in my childhood brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a kid, I was an idealist. When I learned that there were poor people, I thought we should give them money. When I imagined growing up, I pictured opening a grocery store where everything was free. And when I learned that we were trapped by earth’s gravity, I thought that we should build rockets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was always trying to invent things. At age 3, I was trying to build forts and airplanes. At age 5, I was trying to build robots and time machines. I didn’t have any doubt that these were things we could do — I knew it was just a matter of time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And so when I heard about black holes, I knew that they were out there. And when I learned about the Theory of Relativity, I had no trouble believing it. And when adults cautioned me that they really weren’t sure about any of this yet, I thought that they were quite silly. Of &lt;em&gt;course&lt;/em&gt; there were black holes. Of &lt;em&gt;course&lt;/em&gt; time dilation was possible. Of &lt;em&gt;course&lt;/em&gt; the universe was massive and ripe for exploration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For me — in my innocence and idealism and naiveté — inventing new technologies and exploring the universe was the most obvious thing in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a society, we tend to be much more cynical. We worry much more about practicality and pragmatism. We are concerned that big aspirations point to some sort of psychological deficit. We’re like the Freudian psychologist in Miracle on 34th Street: desperately trying to diagnose all the happiness and optimism as some sort of repressed trauma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is why I am so inescapably Christian. And why I resonate so deeply with &lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/series/christianity-and-transhumanism"&gt;transhumanism&lt;/a&gt;. Because in them, we celebrate this idealism. We celebrate this naiveté. We look upon the universe with childlike innocence, and see a glorious place to explore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that, really, is what Christmas is about. It’s the time that our society sets aside to celebrate the naive, and to indulge our idealism. It’s the time we dare to dream great dreams, and make big wishes, and sing &lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/12/25/christmas"&gt;audacious songs&lt;/a&gt; about a radically better future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And when we decorate our Christmas trees, is it any wonder that we string them with twinkling lights, and point them towards the stars?&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2009/01/05/the-greatest-new-years-resolution-ever/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2009/01/05/the-greatest-new-years-resolution-ever/</link><pubDate>Mon Jan 05 18:57:49 CST 2009</pubDate><title>The Greatest New Year's Resolution Ever</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>We're setting out to accomplish our resolutions for the new year.

And they're going to be entirely different than anything you've ever seen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The first problem&lt;/em&gt; with most resolutions is that they shoot too low. Lose 10 pounds, exercise a little, stop drinking so much egg-nog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nobody cares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And so these resolutions are forgotten as quickly and lightly as they are made.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;“Make no little plans. They have no magic to stir men’s blood.” (Daniel Burnham)&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We’re going to do exactly the opposite of what people normally do. A small group of us has compiled a &lt;a href="http://theresolutionbegins.com/the-list-of-resolutions/"&gt;list of resolutions&lt;/a&gt; that are life-changing, world-shattering, and above all, BOLD. We are defying the forces of entropy and blandness, and are setting out to make a year that will reverberate with greatness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The second problem&lt;/em&gt; with typical resolutions is that they aim to AVOID something, to hold out on eating that gingerbread man (maybe - hopefully - perhaps) until the month of February. By DEFINITION, these resolutions are broken almost as soon as they are made, as human willpower fails. By the time March rolls around, nothing of those pale resolutions is left.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By contrast, almost all of our resolutions are ACCOMPLISHMENTS, things we can go out and achieve, and once achieved, can never be taken from us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The third problem&lt;/em&gt; with new year’s resolutions is that they’re personal and self-centered. Ours are exactly the opposite, resolutions born of a small group, but spreading and growing in their audacity and scope as they go, inviting and provoking ever more people to join in our great effort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So we're launching a new website and blog for this fantastic endeavor. And we want you to be a part of it. It's called:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://theresolutionbegins.com/"&gt;The Resolution Begins!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2010/12/10/libertarians-and-airport-body-scans/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2010/12/10/libertarians-and-airport-body-scans/</link><pubDate>Fri Dec 10 10:51:42 CST 2010</pubDate><title>Libertarians and Airport Body-Scans</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>I've been thinking about the libertarian position on airport full-body scans.

After all, libertarians are known, above all, for their stance on personal freedom. So it would seem that libertarians would be against this invasion of personal privacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, libertarians also support the freedom of organizations and institutions to determine their own rules, to decide who they will refuse service to, and to specify the appropriate ways to act when you are in their territory. So it would seem that libertarians would be in favor of the airport's right to require body scans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The truth is, the decision for or against body scans is a decision about safety versus privacy. The airports have a right to determine how safe they  want to be. More significantly, the passengers have a right to determine how safe they want to be, AND how much they value their privacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is a delicate balancing act. How do we know the right balance between safety and privacy?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The truth is, we don't.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And this leads us to the real question: "who gets to choose?" And the heart of the real issue: the government is choosing for us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's not the airlines, the airports, or the passengers choosing a position in this delicate balancing act. It's an outside force. And no external force can understand as much about the values and needs of the passengers as the people directly involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Government, as long as it comes in as an outside force making decisions for us, removes our freedom, and will always lead to human suffering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, in an organic society, the passengers and the airlines would come to a position delicately, they would be quick to adjust to changing needs and realizations, and they would do so honoring the desires of every individual…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;…rather than exercising an edict passed down from on high.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2008/01/01/the-physics-of-immortality-2007/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2008/01/01/the-physics-of-immortality-2007/</link><pubDate>Tue Jan 01 13:20:00 CST 2008</pubDate><title>The Physics of Immortality (2007)</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>The latest thought-provoking release from the band that invented Rock Philosophy.

Tests were conclusive: 100% of lab mice both liked "rock &amp;amp; roll" and were interested in "saving the world".&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scientists were quick to point out that they had not examined the effect the Kryptonite they put in the mice's food had on this study. Nor have they conclusively proved that this connection exists in humans. After all, most humans don't have the advantage of a third ear on their backs for listening to rock music, like these mice had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next step, these scientists point out, is to compare 15-year-old kids who listen to blaring rock music in their rooms all day, with a 30-year-old guy strapped in a room, forced to listen to Michael Bolton for 30 hours straight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Whichever one is more interested in saving the world at the end of this process is clearly the winner here," the lead scientist orated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lab mice could not be reached for comment. They apparently couldn't hear the phone ringing over their loud rock music.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/04/16/his-enemies-beneath-his-feet/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/04/16/his-enemies-beneath-his-feet/</link><pubDate>Mon Apr 16 11:40:54 CDT 2012</pubDate><title>His enemies beneath his feet...</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>For a while, I've been trying to puzzle out the chronology of 1 Corinthians 15:20-28, and finding it incredibly difficult.

But here's a little bit of what I've noticed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hebrews 2:5-9 talks about everything being put under Jesus' feet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;5 For it was not to angels that God subjected the world to come, of which we are speaking. 6 It has been testified somewhere,&lt;br/&gt;“What is man, that you are mindful of him,&lt;br/&gt;or the son of man, that you care for him?&lt;br/&gt;7 You made him for a little while lower than the angels;&lt;br/&gt;you have crowned him with glory and honor,&lt;br/&gt;8 putting everything in subjection under his feet.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now in putting everything in subjection to him, he left nothing outside his control.&lt;br/&gt;At present, we do not yet see everything in subjection to him. 9 But we see him who for a little while was made lower than the angels, namely Jesus, crowned with glory and honor because of the suffering of death, so that by the grace of God he might taste death for everyone. (Hebrews 2:5-9) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is taking a passage from Psalms, about the glorification of human beings, and applying it to Jesus. And what it says is that Jesus, as representative of humanity, has been given authority over everything. But this is not currently seen - the world around does not notice that this is the case. Christians, however, having experienced Jesus' death and resurrection, know the truth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notice how the passage begins. God has subjected the "world to come" to Jesus. So Jesus has been given authority now, will have that authority ultimately revealed, and will continue to rule the world to come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, Ephesians 1:20-23:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;20 that he worked in Christ when he raised him from the dead and seated him at his right hand in the heavenly places, 21 far above all rule and authority and power and dominion, and above every name that is named, not only in this age but also in the one to come. 22 And he put all things under his feet and gave him as head over all things to the church, 23 which is his body, the fullness of him who fills all in all. (Ephesians 1:20-23)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;So Jesus has been given authority over everything, both in this age and in the age to come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, a few notes about 1 Corinthians 15:20-28:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Viewpoint 1:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;20 But Christ has indeed been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep. 21 For since death came through a man, the resurrection of the dead comes also through a man. 22 For as in Adam all die, so in Christ all will be made alive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;So he seems to be about to describe universal resurrection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;23 But each in turn:&lt;br/&gt;Christ, the firstfruits;&lt;br/&gt;then, when he comes, those who belong to him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fairly straight-forward so far. Jesus is raised, then at his Parousia, his followers are raised. This sounds like what happens in Revelation 20, with the "first resurrection".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;24 Then the end will come,&lt;br/&gt;when he hands over the kingdom to God the Father after he has destroyed all dominion, authority and power. 25 For he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet. 26 The last enemy to be destroyed is death. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;So now I'm confused. This sounds like he is reigning &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt; (time of writing), and will cease reigning when he has accomplished his purposes, handing the kingdom back over to God. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if we take the other passages, it would seem maybe we're looking at something else. Jesus is reigning now, and the outworking of his reign is to defeat his enemies. The language is a little different, because the other passages assumed the "putting under his feet" already happened, while this approaches the "putting under his feet" as an ongoing process that Jesus accomplishes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the upshot is the same. It is not that Jesus gives up the kingdom at the endpoint of this, but that Jesus has succeeded in making his enemies submit to God, thus "handing them over".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jesus can maintain control of the kingdom, but now the kingdom will be totally submissive to God, because Jesus is totally submissive to God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;27 For he “has put everything under his feet.” Now when it says that “everything” has been put under him, it is clear that this does not include God himself, who put everything under Christ. 28 When he has done this, then the Son himself will be made subject to him who put everything under him, so that God may be all in all. (1 Corinthians 15:20-28) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why would we assume Jesus will still be reigning? Because the other passages indicate Jesus would rule the "age to come" or "the world to come". &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unless…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unless, the age to come terminates at "the end", instead of &lt;em&gt;beginning&lt;/em&gt; at the end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let's look at it that way:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Viewpoint 2:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;20 But Christ has indeed been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep. 21 For since death came through a man, the resurrection of the dead comes also through a man. 22 For as in Adam all die, so in Christ all will be made alive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Okay, he's about to describe the order of universal resurrection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;23 But each in turn:&lt;br/&gt;Christ, the firstfruits;&lt;br/&gt;then, when he comes, those who belong to him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Okay, so he comes, raises his followers, and begins the "age to come", reigning over it fully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;24 Then the end will come, when he hands over the kingdom to God the Father after he has destroyed all dominion, authority and power. 25 For he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;His reign continues to extend until his has finally not only shown his authority, but abolished all opposition. Then even the "age to come" ends, and Jesus' reign is complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;26 The last enemy to be destroyed is death. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that's when the resurrection of the rest of the dead occurs. This seems to be pictured in Revelation with the destruction of death and hades and the "final judgment".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;27 For he “has put everything under his feet.” Now when it says that “everything” has been put under him, it is clear that this does not include God himself, who put everything under Christ. 28 When he has done this, then the Son himself will be made subject to him who put everything under him, so that God may be all in all. (1 Corinthians 15:20-28) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;So now we have three steps. Jesus being given the authority (resurrection and ascension), then finally making that known (coming, Parousia), then ruling until he has finally demolished all of his enemies (the end).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This, however, leaves us with some interesting stuff at the end of 1 Corinthians 15 to account for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;47 The first man was of the dust of the earth; the second man is of heaven. 48 As was the earthly man, so are those who are of the earth; and as is the heavenly man, so also are those who are of heaven. 49 And just as we have borne the image of the earthly man, so shall we bear the image of the heavenly man. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;So this is describing what it is like to be resurrected. And is focused on "us", ie, "those who are Christ's at his coming".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;50 I declare to you, brothers and sisters, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, nor does the perishable inherit the imperishable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The inheriting of the kingdom of God should happen at Christ's coming (Parousia). The people who are inheriting are the Christians being addressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;51 Listen, I tell you a mystery: We will not all sleep, but we will all be changed— 52 in a flash, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, the dead will be raised imperishable, and we will be changed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;So that first resurrection will raise the dead, but will change the living. This is the "last trumpet", and so I would have previously assumed it to be "the end", but the passage doesn't say that. It would seem to indicate the last pre-ordained moment. Perhaps "the end" is not pre-ordained to a specific time, thus not connected to a "trumpet"?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notice that he's not saying you have to be dead to inherit the kingdom. He's saying "flesh and blood" can't inherit it, and so the living must be "clothed" with something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;53 For the perishable must clothe itself with the imperishable, and the mortal with immortality. 54 When the perishable has been clothed with the imperishable, and the mortal with immortality, then the saying that is written will come true: “Death has been swallowed up in victory.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This "change" marks the victory over death. For who?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;55 “Where, O death, is your victory?&lt;br/&gt; Where, O death, is your sting?” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;56 The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law. 57 But thanks be to God! He gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would have previously seen this as the "defeat of death" at "the end". But the context focuses on victory over death for the Christians. So this fits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We're dealing with some odd stuff, I'll give you that. Any thoughts, feedback?&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/new-god-argument-and-a-new-apologetics/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/new-god-argument-and-a-new-apologetics/</link><pubDate>Wed Jan 20 23:33:22 CST 2016</pubDate><title>The New God Argument and A New Apologetics</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>Recently my friend Lincoln Cannon released the third version of his groundbreaking [New God Argument](http://new-god-argument.com/).

This argument is a philosophical justification for trust in God, laying the technical groundwork for a rational approach to religion and theology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a technical philosophical work, appreciating it requires overcoming some fairly big obstacles. Additionally, it’s an argument that was crafted within a Mormon context, with a cosmology and language unfamiliar to most religious people. This means that mainstream Christians will most likely have trouble seeing how it could relate to their faith and understanding of their religion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these obstacles, I believe that this argument represents a new kind of apologetics, an apologetics that ultimately has much more to offer the world than the apologetics that we have known. Beyond the argument’s own merits, the very approach it takes is a substantial reorientation from prior approaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;First, it is based on the future, not the past.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Classical apologetics asks us to reason backwards to first causes, or original &lt;em&gt;unmoved movers&lt;/em&gt;. This means that God is always conceived primarily in terms of that which is behind us. History is then seen as the flight from God, the never-ending descent from original perfection — and human life and civilization easily become portrayed as a meaningless effort doomed to failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As several generations of theologians have been telling us, this perspective is neither biblical nor wise. God should not be portrayed as being primarily in the past — just as religion should not be construed as a call to return to some earlier way of life (say, the 1950s, or the 1780s, or even the first century).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The biblical God is primarily a God of the future — a God whose most intense displays of power are yet to come. It is, after all, “kingdom come”, not “kingdom &lt;em&gt;gone&lt;/em&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is time for our theology and our apologetics to reflect that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Second, it is based on action, not mere assent.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In much of Christian culture, “faith” has become collapsed into something a lot like “intellectual assent”. This means that questions about the age of the earth, the geographic nature of Noah’s flood, and the taxonomy of Jonah’s fish, become portrayed as significant and viable concerns — concerns which could potentially have eternal consequences for the fate of your soul. Even when those particular issues aren’t being argued over, others usually are. In practice, this means that “faith” is agreeing with a particular set of assertions, and disagreeing with another set.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This state of affairs is a far cry from the biblical example of Abraham, whose faith consisted of heading off into the wilderness, leaving his homeland in pursuit of a future civilization that no one else could possibly foresee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is clear from the biblical record that Abraham was incredibly conflicted about all of this. He could never quite stick to the plan, and kept waffling on even the most minor of issues. Nevertheless, his persistence earned him the title “the father of faith” — not because of how he felt, or what he said or thought he believed — but because of the future his actions testified to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I call this &lt;em&gt;enacted trust&lt;/em&gt;, and it is the difference between the faith by which Abraham was justified, and the faith by which “even the demons believe, and tremble.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Third, it connects our belief in humanity and our belief in God.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is common in traditional apologetics to end up arguing in favor of a God who has no obvious interest in the human race. In this approach, apologetics creates an implicit divide between our interest in God and our interest in humanity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This feeling is at the heart of secular humanism, which takes the division implied by traditional apologetics, and makes it explicit. In secular humanism, to believe in humanity is to *dis*believe in God. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this divide is deeply problematic for Christians. After all, Christians affirm that God created humans &lt;em&gt;in his image&lt;/em&gt;, and then went even further and &lt;em&gt;became human&lt;/em&gt; in the person of Jesus Christ. From the very beginning of the Jewish and Christian scriptures, God is incredibly invested in humanity, continually concerned with our lives, our society, and our progress. For Christians, there can ultimately be no great divide, because God has thrown in his lot with the human race. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Christianity, &lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/2013/01/01/human-race-problem-evil"&gt;to believe in God is to believe in humanity, and to believe in humanity is to believe in God&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=%E2%80%9CTo%20believe%20in%20God%20is%20to%20believe%20in%20humanity.%20To%20believe%20in%20humanity%20is%20to%20believe%20in%20God.%E2%80%9D&amp;url=http://micahredding.com/blog/new-god-argument-and-a-new-apologetics&amp;via=micahtredding"&gt;[tweet this]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until our apologetics embrace this most Christian of understandings, our apologetics won’t be Christian at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The New Apologetics&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I believe that our future as communities of faith will require reorienting the way we understand the connection between theology, faith, and action — and will demand a more Christian approach to the relationship between God and humanity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This will effectively be a new apologetics, an apologetics much fuller and richer than the apologetics of the past, an apologetics which echoes Jesus’ call to invest all of our heart, soul, mind, and strength.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New God Argument points us towards this new apologetics, taking the first step on a long and thrilling path of exploration. But although this may be the first step down that road, it won’t be the last. Exciting times lie ahead, and we can hardly do better than to heed the cry of C.S. Lewis: “Further up and further in!”&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2005/06/21/batman/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2005/06/21/batman/</link><pubDate>Tue Jun 21 20:48:00 CDT 2005</pubDate><title>Batman!</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>I went and saw Batman Begins the other night, and it was by far the best Batman movie ever.

&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lot of people say that you know you're successful when you attract haters. This is kind of like a new-fangled version of "my art will be renowned after I die". It might be, or you might just suck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The truth is that taking a stand will attract opposition. The harder truth is that opposition doesn't tell you whether or not your stand is worthwhile. You have to find that out on your own, and neither pleasing everybody, nor reveling in your opposition, will do anything to help you answer that question for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Life is a struggle for almost everybody. But maybe the focus of that realization is wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Life isn't a struggle just because life is hard. Some people have struggles finding food to eat, other people have struggles getting an uptick on the profitability of their stock portfolio. We all have struggles, but these struggles are not the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bigger truth is that we all struggle because that is what we are made to do. We are made to reach beyond our current situation, and strive for something we do not have. No one ever stops struggling, because humans are strugglers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Happiness is not in the end of the struggle, but in the overcoming of one struggle, and moving on to another. Our sense of peace and contentment comes from the &lt;em&gt;slope&lt;/em&gt; of the progression of struggles we deal with. Too steep of a slope, we will be eternally frustrated. Too slight a slope, we will be bored and complacent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Happiness is finding your slope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've started using &lt;a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/"&gt;Markdown&lt;/a&gt; for all my writing. I do this for a couple of reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main one is data portability - future proofing what I write. Maybe I decide to change blog software, maybe I decide to export all my content. I'd rather know that it's all plain text, something I can carry anywhere. This way I don't have to worry about software updates, etc. No matter what form it shows up in, the content will be readable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there's a slightly more philosophical reason as well. I don't like the fact that things like &lt;em&gt;emphasis&lt;/em&gt; and bullets and so forth are things that reside outside our language. In books, we rely on the typesetters to put them into the words for us. In blogging, we rely on some kind of software editor, or on using HTML. But if the &lt;em&gt;emphasis&lt;/em&gt; is part of the &lt;strong&gt;meaning&lt;/strong&gt; of the text, shouldn't it exist inside the text? Shouldn't it be part of the character-set, the alphabet of our writing?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Markup allows us to use italics and bold-face as &lt;em&gt;punctuation&lt;/em&gt;, rather than superficial styling. As such, that meaning will not be lost in an errant copy-paste operation, or a bad software update.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;---&lt;br/&gt;Adapting the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis's_trilemma"&gt;Lord, Liar, Lunatic trilemma&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href="http://www.simulation-argument.com/"&gt;Simulation Argument&lt;/a&gt;, or,&lt;br/&gt;The Simulation Argument as Josh McDowell would put it:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suicide, Censorship, or Simulation.&lt;/p&gt;

How well I've lived up to them is open to discussion, but here they are again.&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I promised you my resolutions for this year, so here they are: &lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;1) Write More Songs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;Writing songs is one of the few things in life that is good in itself. It doesn't matter if people hear the songs, or if they ever get played on the radio; when you've written a really good song, just knowing that is rewarding. So I want to spend more time this year writing songs. And I want to write more interesting, and more varied, and more complex songs.&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;2) Spend Less Time on the Internet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;I was almost entirely without the internet for the last week and a half, and my lifestyle has been very different. I started doing more things just to be creative, started reading some books, and was more relaxed. I didn't realize the internet took up so much of my time, and how very little of that time spent actually accomplishes anything.&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;3) Spend More Time with People&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;In keeping myself busy with my work, my dayjob, my routines, the internet, and strategizing, I don't always get as many opportunities to meet and spend time with people as I would like. So I'm going to try to do that more. I'm going to try to just goof off more.&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;4) Eat &amp;amp; Live Healthier&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;My habits of work, staying up until 1-2am, driving out of state every weekend, and eating a diet of slimfast, eggs, and peanut butter sandwiches is probably going to catch up with me at some point. So I'm going to try to switch up my diet from time to time...which will probably involve actually taking TIME to prepare food, rather than just slapping together whatever I've got. Guess my crazy rock &amp;amp; roll lifestyle has got to slow down.&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;Anyway, those are my resolutions. Enjoy.&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;-micah&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2008/03/04/babies-see-pure-color-or-why-pink/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2008/03/04/babies-see-pure-color-or-why-pink/</link><pubDate>Tue Mar 04 15:38:00 CST 2008</pubDate><title>Babies see pure color, or, Why Pink?</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>Scientists have discovered that babies see colors differently than adults.

Where babies see things are they "are", adults process colors through the filter of their language. Apparently, people who speak Russian see blue differently than people who speak English.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://blog.wired.com/wiredscience/2008/03/babies-see-pure.html"&gt;Babies See Pure Color&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This makes sense to me. After all, why does "pink" exist? We call light blue "blue", but we call light red "pink". Why is that?! Our language has made a different color where one never existed before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of the time, when we look at a person or a thing or a color, we don't see it for what it is. Instead, we mentally label it with some tag, like "pink". That tag might have all kinds of thoughts and emotions attached to it. But that tag is not the real thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes, if you look hard enough, you can see things as they really are. It might just last a second, but during that second, the world is so amazing.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2010/02/06/paddling-into-the-waves/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2010/02/06/paddling-into-the-waves/</link><pubDate>Sat Feb 06 23:10:31 CST 2010</pubDate><title>Paddling into the waves</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>I wrote this on October 8, 2008, 10:51pm.

It has been here waiting ever since. It has been long enough. -micah&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;---&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today I set out to understand myself. My peculiar mix of emotions and thoughts and attitudes - where does it come from? Whatever I am, it must be rooted in how I was when I was young.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I thought back to what it was like to be 5 years old - running around like I was superman, in a world of simplicity and brightness. But even there, I recognized a theme. I distinctly remember feeling a sadness, an empathy for others, and for what I would now call the injury of innocence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had dreams when I was 5. In one of them, my mom had a flower in a clay pot, and she loved that flower dearly. My dad decided to do something nice for her, and sent it away to a place where they turned it into a mush, a kind of potpourri. He was trying to do something nice, but it broke her heart. She cried and cried.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I remember waking up and feeling so sad. I didn't know whether it was real, but I was afraid of my dad. Not because of anything he had done, but because he caused such sadness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later on I would have dreams during which a young girl would get her hopes up that I would do something nice or fun for her, and she would be so thrilled. Then, when I wasn't able to do what she was anticipation, she would cry. I would wake up sad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an earlier dream, I had a pet duck. And this duck had an outfit that matched mine. And when I was younger (so I dreamed), we had gone to church together in our matching outfits. We had been together since we were young. This duck had a nice environment to live in, but we would occasionally take him out of his cage, and let him walk outside. And in my dream, he flew away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was 5 years old. I cried for 5 days afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where, I wondered, did this come from? My intense empathy, my bitter-sweet sense of other's longings, my sadness at other's innocent expectations disappointed?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I thought farther back. Several incidents occurred to me. My dad and I had been walking on the beach in Oregon one day (I would have been 3), and found a unique rock, full of holes. The holes went all the way through it, like a network of tunnels. In a special indentation, like a puzzle, a shell was fitted. I loved that rock. It was mine and dad's, from a time I knew about, but couldn't even remember.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One day, my brother climbed through my window, and knocked it to the ground, smashing it to pieces. I was heart-broken. I wanted to pick up the pieces and put it together again. I sketched a picture, trying to figure out how to get it back together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even earlier, I remember two incidences that were strangely similar. In one, my grandparents were visiting me in Oregon, and we were at a stream or river, playing in the water. Something floated by that caught my attention, and my grandparents told me to swim to get it. I tried, but the more I swam, the farther away it got. Finally, it drifted around the bend, and was gone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm sure the sadness of a three-year-old boy paddling madly after something that is constantly slipping farther away is hard to grasp. Perhaps it will help to explain that somehow I perceived that object as special and beautiful just because my grandparents had sent me to get it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other event was at the ocean. Dad and I were walking along the beach, and throwing things into the waves. We saw a unique board floating in the water - and in some way it was special. Dad told me to swim after it, so I did. But the harder I swam, the farther away the board got, being carried over the crest of each wave farther out to sea. I wanted it, I longed for it, but my fear and powerlessness towards the ocean held me back. And so I swam, watching it drift farther from me, until it finally vanished.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Somehow, that memory has stuck with me, and the feeling of it has permeated me from top to bottom, coloring everything else I've ever done. When I look at the world, I see it through the shades of that longing. Every relationship is tinged with the sadness of my heavy touch on their light innocence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Somehow, I think I will aways be that boy paddling desperately into the waves, watching as the thing he longs for slips farther and farther away.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2014/06/19/incoherent-essays/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2014/06/19/incoherent-essays/</link><pubDate>Thu Jun 19 22:28:08 CDT 2014</pubDate><title>Incoherent Essays: Words Written Half-Awake</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>*You too can receive incoherent essays from the morning scrawlings of my sleep-addled mind!*

I’ve heard from so many sources that this practice, and this practice alone, is the really transformative one — the one that seems to magically unlock creative juices, and unleash the beast within, so to speak. Screenwriters, lyricists, gurus, and novelists all attest to its powers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I thought I’d give it a try.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is officially something like &lt;a href="http://juliacameronlive.com/"&gt;morning pages&lt;/a&gt;, and there are many versions of it around. But my approach is simple: wake up at 6am, and then quickly write 500 words before I shower or eat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Small glitch: I’m not that used to waking up at 6am. After spending eight years as a rock musician, and then the last several years as a computer programmer, my sleep cycle leans heavily into the dark parts of the dial. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So this morning, as I was writing something about the creative buildup of ideas, and then woke up a second later writing something about the new Amazon Fire phone, I realized that I had been falling asleep during the paragraph breaks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One thing I’ve been aware of in my &lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/2013/06/07/iron-man-and-modern-identity-crisis"&gt;normal, non-6am writing&lt;/a&gt;, is that I like to dance on the line between coherence and incoherence. I hope that my readers, whoever they are, are able to follow along; but I also hope that the experience is something like a roller coaster, always seeming to teeter on the edge of total chaos. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If I’m successful, the readers of my normal essays might get a little whiplash, but they’ll emerge excited and energized by the experience. If I push towards incoherence too hard, then they’ll fly off the rails, and I’ll lose them forever. If I don’t push hard enough, then they’ll have had a smooth ride, but it will have been as unremarkable as the teacup ride at Disneyland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least, that’s how I see it. I try to stay on that line, and I’m always trying to push it just a little, always introducing a little insanity into the mix. But I try to watch the limits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apparently, at six in the morning, those limits go out the window. Reading back over the essays from the last few days, some of it makes perfect sense — and some of it is following a twisted and beautiful logic that only non-waking minds can really follow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least, that’s my guess, since I’m awake right now, and it makes no sense to me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So here’s the deal. I thought it might be fun to share a few of these essays a week. Some of them might make a lot of sense, some of them might make no sense, and all of them will probably include obscure references and inside jokes. I’m not going to edit these, except for spelling, and maybe adding a few links to hint at what my sleep-addled mind is trying to say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you enjoy it, great! If you don’t enjoy it, unsubscribe at any point. And if it stops being fun for me, I stop doing it. :) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So there you go. Who’s ready for some incoherent essays?!&lt;/p&gt;

I did not become aware of this through any direct connection with the congregation, but through a series of declamations and comments posted on Facebook. Many of these comments accused this congregation of seeking to become more worldly, of seeking to appeal to modern society rather than to God, of seeking to elevate emotion over truth, of seeking to take “the easy way out”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are some strong accusations, and if true, should be taken seriously. On the other hand, if they are false — if in fact this congregation was seeking to align themselves with the will of God to the best of their ability — then these comments are unfitting for Christians, and should be repudiated by all responsible and mature individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have no personal connection with this congregation, and so will not comment further on their motives or decisions. Instead, I wish to address the larger issue that seems to be provoking the comments. This issue is simply the question of whether women are permitted by God to teach in gatherings of the church.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people believe that they are not — that in fact, God has specified that only men are to speak publicly in church settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other people sincerely believe the opposite — that in fact, God has specified that both men and women are to speak publicly in church settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are fallible human beings, and are capable of coming to erroneous conclusions. So it is good, when there is significant disagreement, for those disagreements to be discussed, debated, and reasoned over. That would be a fitting response to a church coming to an incorrect conclusion, and making a wrong choice: those who disagreed with the conclusion could address it, present their own reasoning, and ask for a sincere response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is not what has happened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I will not describe at length what &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; happened, what I &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; observed, other than the short description given at the beginning of this letter. But as unfitting as many of these comments and reactions have been, I believe that they arise from an understandable source: the sense that no one could possibly have come to this particular conclusion — the conclusion that the Fourth Avenue Church of Christ &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; come to — without first having abandoned some core concept of the faith.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I want to address this incredulity and disbelief head-on. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I believe that God has specified his intention that both men and women should serve and teach equally in the service of the church. I believe that Jesus demonstrated this, that Paul commanded it, and that this was the practice of the first century Christians. I believe that this is the clear teaching of the Bible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I believe that this first century teaching and practice was abandoned through compromise with worldly values. I believe that in the centuries after Christ, the church abandoned this fundamental Christian truth, and instead adopted the practices and values of the popular culture. I believe that God’s teaching were abandoned in favor of the traditions of men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I believe that those who say women are not permitted to speak in the church are simply wrong. They have not &lt;em&gt;rightly divided the word of truth&lt;/em&gt;. They have not understood the teachings of Christ, or obeyed the commands of Paul, or followed the example of the early church. They have fallen into severe error, and have gone against the word of God.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I do not blame those who have made this mistake. Interpreting the scriptures can sometimes be difficult, as the apostle Peter testified. It is even more difficult when we bring the baggage of human custom and popular tradition. If we have not been challenged to look closely, we can sometimes go years without observing what is right in front of our eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that is the case here. The truth has been clearly manifest, but we have not always been ready and willing to seeing it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But although God may forgive us our ignorance, he does not wish us to remain ignorant. Though he may forgive us our blindness to his will, he does not wish us to remain blind. He calls us always to repent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I did not come to this conclusion through some pre-existing philosophy, or through pressure from some external force, or through a desire to appeal to the culture, or from a wish to take the easy way out. Far from it: I came to this conclusion as a young man, interested solely in better understanding the teachings of the New Testament. To that end, I studied in great depth. I wished to follow the example of those who came before me, who sought to follow the words of God, over and against all human custom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My conclusion was reached with trepidation. But it was clear. From Peter’s first sermon on Pentecost, the message that women were to participate equally in the kingdom of God was deliberately proclaimed. The examples given in scripture made it manifest. The meaning and reason behind it were explained by Paul. And in every place, the churches of the New Testament engaged in this revolutionary practice, over and against the culture around them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even secular history speaks to the early church beginning with the full inclusion of women, and then gradually giving this up, eventually fully embracing the male-only leadership practices of the Roman Empire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of you cannot believe this. Many of you may find this unfathomable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it is nevertheless true. Truth does not bend to our emotions. Truth is truth, regardless of our traditions or customs. And so I ask you to look again. Read the scriptures with fresh eyes. Remove your blinders and look beyond your traditions, and seek the truth that God has conveyed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And regardless of what you find, know that there are those of us for whom this issue is not a matter of preference or culture, but is a matter of absolute importance, a concrete matter of obedience to the word of God.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2007/06/14/good-is-not-negative/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2007/06/14/good-is-not-negative/</link><pubDate>Thu Jun 14 12:38:00 CDT 2007</pubDate><title>Good is Not Negative</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>In response to my post on The Problem of Evil, some atheists over at Way of The Mind have been discussing the issue.

The relevant argument they've been making is that my reasoning means that there are beings who suffer so much, God should have never created them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The crucial point here that occurs to me is that "good" is a non-negative value. "Evil" is just the absence of good, it is not negative on the "good" scale. To see how this plays out, let's imagine that we can rank the good experienced by a creature as ranging from 0 to 10 (in reality, good should be measured from 0 to infinity).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here might be what we would see:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;10 - &lt;/span&gt;A being which experiences only happiness for its entire life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;5 - &lt;/span&gt;A being which experiences a moderate amount of suffering, but also experiences joy and liberal amounts of happiness. Like you and me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;3 - &lt;/span&gt;People who contemplate suicide. These people may feel that their current state is so unhappy, they want to kill themselves. But they have still experienced much joy and goodness in their life previous to this thought process. So their existence overall is still relatively good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;2 - &lt;/span&gt;People why try to commit suicide, but can't. Perhaps they are in mental hospitals. They desperately want to end their lives, but are prevented from doing so. But they have still experienced much joy and goodness in their lives, prior to their current state. So their existence overall is still good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;1 - &lt;/span&gt;A person who is tortured most of their life. There are still glimmers of goodness and joy, but they come rarely. It still is better for this person to exist than to not exist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;0 - &lt;/span&gt;A theoretical being that these atheists are postulating, which experiences absolutely no joy or happiness during its entire life.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, if there is a person named Bob who experiences some non-zero good, then the benevolent thing for God to do is to create Bob.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If Bob experiences good that is exactly 0, then it is neither benevolent nor evil to create Bob. Bob exerts a net 0 influence on the amount of good in the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If there is some person named Tom who experiences good that is greater than 0, and whose existence requires the existence of Bob, then the benevolent thing for God to do is to create Bob, so that Tom may exist.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2006/11/22/march-9-2007-or-how-the-redding-brothers-will-rock-the-world/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2006/11/22/march-9-2007-or-how-the-redding-brothers-will-rock-the-world/</link><pubDate>Wed Nov 22 23:57:00 CST 2006</pubDate><title>March 9, 2007 - or, How The Redding Brothers will Rock the World</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>Folks, we are busy gearing up for the March 9th, 2007 concert at the Charleston Civic Center.

Yes, we are working on it already! What I'd like to tell you are some of the things that are going into this show. So first of all, a few fun facts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will be THE Release Party for our (as yet untitled) brand new CD. Nashville will get a release party, but it won't be like this one. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We (The Redding Brothers) will be coming back to WV for the first time in a while. Since we moved to Nashville, we've been performing around the country, and haven't had the chance to play a big show in WV for quite some time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will be in the &lt;strong&gt;Charleston Civic Center&lt;/strong&gt;...did I mention that that's huge? We had been throwing our own concerts in the local movie theaters, but we needed more space, and we needed to focus more on the music, and less on building stages and other equipment to turn a cinema into a concert hall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More to come...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-micah&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2006/11/22/welcome-to-i-heart-polar-bears/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2006/11/22/welcome-to-i-heart-polar-bears/</link><pubDate>Wed Nov 22 23:22:00 CST 2006</pubDate><title>Welcome to I Heart Polar Bears!</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>Well, this is it.

It makes me constantly question and measure and analyze — holding everything I’m doing up to inspection, trying to figure out how it matches to the two different impulses that battle for my soul.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first impulse, maybe my deepest impulse, is to be a purist and an idealist. That means being a revolutionary, being willing to forsake my friends and my family and my society, and run headlong into the future. This is the side of me that is drawn towards the Anabaptists, the pioneers of non-violent resistance, the anarchists and the rock musicians, the vegetarians and the libertarians and the poets of whom the world was not worthy. This is the side that leans towards gnosticism, that wishes to escape the body, that sees itself as living in the Matrix, battling for freedom against the illusions that control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second impulse is to embrace the world. This means seeing the intense wisdom in the things that &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt;, understanding them as manifestations of a deep order, embracing a sort of conservatism and orthodoxy that values the traditions and rituals of society, the customs and values layered on over time, the real value of family and friendships and childhood and marriage and organic, earthy, rhythmic life. This is the impulse to build on what is here; it is the impulse to invest in business, to be involved in local politics, to compromise my ideals, to buy organic and grass-fed and fair-trade, to own bluegrass music and the newest iPhone. This is the side of me that is drawn towards Judaism and Eastern Orthodoxy, that wishes to embrace the body, to extend life into the hundreds of years, to dabble in power, pursue influence, and own land.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second impulse comes to me by way of a wonderful childhood. A large, energetic and creative family, adventures all across the country, an ancestry full of people who liked to invent things and dreamed of making rockets. It also comes to me by way of books: the very act of reading draws me into the physical world and the way things are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And yet, the things that drive the second impulse also drive the first. My big family has mostly held to a religious tradition that I regard as entirely radical and revolutionary. I was taught to think for myself — my informal religious education was on the need to abandon the customs of society, culture, and family, and to strike out on my own. Books too, whose very heft seemed to draw me towards materiality, usually held stories of the call to leave behind the known in favor of the unknown. As a child, I felt the pressure of these award-winning children’s books — a pressure that told me I must abandon family to seek out new family, that my childhood world was an illusion that must be overthrown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was as if the medium was telling me one thing, and the message was telling me another. The &lt;em&gt;medium&lt;/em&gt; of family told me to hold on to family and heritage and tradition — but the &lt;em&gt;message&lt;/em&gt; of my family told me to think for myself, to strike out on my own, to discard inherited ties and bonds. The &lt;em&gt;medium&lt;/em&gt; of books told me to hold on to culture and heritage and education — but the &lt;em&gt;message&lt;/em&gt; of books told me to abandon it all in favor of my own radical ideals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe it’s this tension and churn that keeps the whole thing viable. Maybe it’s the paradox of this whole situation that makes it work. But it’s not a tension that resolves cleanly. It doesn’t wrap up neatly at all. Somehow, somewhere, these two things make sense together, in the light of some bigger and more glorious impulse, and I’m always hunting and searching for what exactly that is.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2015/11/16/mars-hill/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2015/11/16/mars-hill/</link><pubDate>Mon Nov 16 13:07:48 CST 2015</pubDate><title>Transhumanism is a Mars Hill opportunity</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>In [Acts 17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+17:16-34), the apostle Paul does something remarkable.

He walks onstage at Mars Hill in Athens, the center of the philosophical tradition of the Greek world, and begins to talk about an unknown god.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike almost every other sermon in Acts, this one does not begin with the story of Israel, or a recitation of scripture. Instead, it begins with an account of Paul’s walk through the city, and all of the idols he had seen there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seeing all of these idols had cut to the core of Paul’s Jewish monotheistic heart. But he doesn’t chastise the crowd. Instead, he points out something he had noticed on his walk, an altar built to “an unknown god”. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the Athenians, this altar was a sort of insurance. They worshipped hundreds of gods, and prided themselves on having their bases covered. So if there was a god that had slipped their notice — they wanted to make sure they covered that too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So this is where Paul starts. He talks about the god they can only worship in ignorance, but which he can now help to reveal. And he proceeds to explain this god, and all of its characteristics and nature — &lt;em&gt;using only quotations from their own philosophers&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Paul, these pagan philosophers were not just accidentally correct. They had, even in their ignorance of the Jewish tradition, nevertheless correctly understood the nature of God. And this must mean that God had revealed himself to them—perhaps in subtle or even hidden ways, but nevertheless truly and authentically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This remarkable attitude is characteristic of the early Christians and their unique belief that Christianity was universally applicable, that it had &lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/2015/08/07/infinite-morality-jesus"&gt;infinite reach&lt;/a&gt;, and that therefore, all truth was God’s truth. For them, Christ had fulfilled the partial and incomplete revelations of generations past, and as the &lt;em&gt;one Messiah&lt;/em&gt; of the universal God, this wasn’t necessarily limited to the revelations the Jews had received.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paul puts words around this in &lt;a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+1%3A19-20&amp;version=NRSV"&gt;Romans 1&lt;/a&gt;, talking about how all of humanity has intuited the nature of God. Theologians call this concept “general revelation”, and it was an attitude that drove early Christian missions for hundreds of years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes Christians discover the aftermath of these missions, and become concerned. For example, people periodically realize that Christmas trees are of pagan origin, and start to campaign against them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the pagan origin of Christmas trees is no secret conspiracy. Rather, it represents an early missionary attempt to take the goodness and truth in local pagan practices, and interpret them in the context of Christ and his mission. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modern Christian practice is scattered through with relics from these kinds of past encounters with paganism. And what all of these encounters have in common is that they were resolved not by Christians stamping out local culture and practice, but by Christians recognizing the value and truth within them, and ultimately adopting them as their own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the approach Paul models for us in Acts 17. Not watering down the truth, not diluting Christian ideas and teachings, but finding and drawing out all the truth God has &lt;a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+17%3A26-28&amp;version=NIV"&gt;scattered throughout the world&lt;/a&gt;. Where there are resonances with things we already believe, we illuminate them, where there are new things to be known, we embrace them. And in all of this, we claim the good, and leave behind the bad — recognizing that even in the darkest of places, &lt;a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+14%3A17&amp;version=NIV"&gt;God has not left himself without a light&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, we have a similar opportunity within the world of &lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/2015/02/27/what-transhumanism-and-why-should-christians-care"&gt;transhumanism&lt;/a&gt;. Transhumanism is usually understood to be a radically secular movement, advocating for controversial and problematic things. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But dig very far into the history and characteristics of transhumanism, and we discover a secular effort largely driven by the visions of Christianity, and by the disappointment in Christianity’s failure to live up to them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where Jesus proclaimed &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+10:8"&gt;heal the sick, feed the hungry, raise the dead&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, Christians have sometimes been more content to follow the path of the Levite priest in the story of the Good Samaritan — and move to the other side of the road. Where Jesus taught his followers to pray &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+6%3A10&amp;version=ESV"&gt;your kingdom come, on earth as it is in heaven&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, Christians have sometimes been more content to counsel abandoning interest in the earth altogether. Where the New Testament talks about Jesus as the beginning of a &lt;a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+2%3A15&amp;version=NIV"&gt;new humanity&lt;/a&gt;—no longer defined by nation, temple, or social class—Christians have sometimes been more content to argue in favor of the old humanity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, transhumanists are often fueled (whether they are aware of it or not) by the echoes of ancient Christian visions of transcendence and transformation. Even the word “transhuman” itself appears to be &lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/2015/11/02/the-word-transhumanist"&gt;of Christian origin&lt;/a&gt;, the result of generations of Christians struggling to express the Christian view of mankind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What all of this means is that the modern transhumanist movement represents a Mars Hill opportunity. An opportunity to recognize truth in every place that God has deposited it, an opportunity to reconnect many of these secular aspirations with their true fullness and depth, and—perhaps most importantly—an opportunity to challenge ourselves to rediscover the full nature of what we believe and profess.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2004/08/26/thank-you-cincinnati/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2004/08/26/thank-you-cincinnati/</link><pubDate>Thu Aug 26 02:28:00 CDT 2004</pubDate><title>Thank You Cincinnati!</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>08/25/04 - The Redding Brothers debuted their show in Cincinnati last weekend to a great response.

It's relatively short, far from comprehensive, and is only an attempt to look at the basics. Essentially, it's an overview of the story of the New Testament, and the times the New Testament authors perceived themselves to be living in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/2008/09/16/apocalypse-been-there-done"&gt;Apocalypse: Been There, Done That&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More important than understanding the WHEN of the Second Coming, is understanding the WHAT and the WHY. And I attempt to address that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The real damage done by pre-millennialism and other religious eschatologies of the last 200 years is that they rob us of an understanding of what God has already done, why Jesus did what he did, and what God is truly interested in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we can discover a better understanding of eschatology, we can recover a better understanding of God.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'd love to discuss this.

This is a great show, very original, entertaining and compelling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything happens in real-time, which is an awesome idea for a show. In other words, the show is an hour long, and covers exactly an hour of plot-time. When the show breaks for commercials, it comes back in exactly that length of time later. The season is 24 episodes long. It's awesome.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It basically has several different stories which intersect going on at the same time. The main guy's daughter gets kidnapped, terrorists plot to kill a presidential candidate, the candidate has some personal family issues going on, etc, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And how awesome is it to watch a bunch of people stay up 24 hours at a time?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(&amp;amp;lt;)(&amp;amp;lt;)(&amp;amp;lt;)(&amp;amp;lt;) 4 Clocks&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/mary-mother-of-god/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/mary-mother-of-god/</link><pubDate>Thu Mar 08 12:00:00 CST 2018</pubDate><title>Mary, Mother of God, Catholic Transhumanist Wonder Woman</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>The more I am exposed to the Catholic aesthetic, the more I understand that for the ancient church, Mary was sort of like Wonder Woman, working against the power of Kings and Empires to smuggle the di...</description><content:encoded>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;The more I am exposed to the Catholic aesthetic, the more I understand that for the ancient church, Mary was sort of like Wonder Woman, working against the power of Kings and Empires to smuggle the divine into the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She strides across the ancient map of the world, thwarting everyone’s control, singing a bawdy song about how the powerful will fall, and the poor will rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She creates life without the help of man, she reverses the creational order of Adam &amp;amp; Eve, she alone bears witness to the full life of Christ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She provokes her son into working miracles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is no wonder they decided she ascended bodily into heaven.

That's okay. Jump to the bottom if this is you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;//&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a few hundred years now, the general scientific consensus has been that immortality is at best unknowable, and at worst, ignorant superstition. I saw a scientist the other day say that we now know immortality to be impossible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which I find funny, because I think the bigger problem in a few years is going to be &lt;em&gt;which immortality do we want&lt;/em&gt;? But more on that later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modern science tells us one major fact: we live in a multitude of universes. I saw a Discovery Channel program the other day talking about 5 different kinds of other universes that probably exist. Every direction we look, we bump into other universes interfering with things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So it is highly probable that our universe is not alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of particular interest are the universes that contain parallel histories. These universes branch off from ours at any incredible rate, spinning off different chains of time in which you ordered something other than your &lt;em&gt;usual&lt;/em&gt; at Starbucks, and in which the breeze caught that girl's hair just a little differently, and in which presidential elections somehow didn't result in a massive outpouring of stupid commentary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every choice you've ever made actually went the other way. Every random meeting happened differently. Your parents raised you differently, you had different friends, you chose a different career, you went to a different school. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the scale of the multiverse, you don't just have one history, you have millions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn't really speculation. It's pretty much what science says. We might argue that science is not the philosophical be-all and end-all (and I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; argue that), but it would be hypocritical of me to sit at a laptop connected to computers on the other side of the world, and deny the science that allows this all to exist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if we accept what science says about the universe, we have to accept that this redefines who &lt;em&gt;we&lt;/em&gt; are. We are no longer individuals living out a narrow band of choices and circumstances; we are individuals diffused across a multitude of realities and histories. We aren't branches, we are trees. We aren't roads, we're interstate highway systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We're like massive rivers pouring across the multiverse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And from that vantage point, we can see what death really is. It's not an end, it's a divergence. It's a rock in the stream - and our massive self simply flows around it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You've had close calls before, when death brushed by and narrowly missed. But from a higher perspective it's clear that all of our close calls are points where reality put a stop to one line of history, and forced us into a different path. Different lines of our personal history come to an end, but rather than mark the end of our "self", they mark the end of one line of story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like a Choose Your Own Adventure book, we keep reading, and when we reach a dead end, we flip back and choose something different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only difference is that with Choose Your Own Adventure books, you always eventually ran out of options. But in reality, there is no limit, there is no end. We keep expanding forever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is called quantum immortality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;//&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's weird, I'll give you that. I read about it when I was 13 years old, and have been living with the idea ever since. So I probably miss some of the strangeness, some of the &lt;em&gt;horror&lt;/em&gt; (?) that this strikes in people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But for me, when I encountered the concept, I instantly knew what it meant. I knew that I believed it. And I knew that it made me fearless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Immortality was no longer something shady and far away, it was something I was experiencing right now. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whatever you believe about immortality and death, I hope you can say the same thing. I hope that it makes you fearless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'd love to hear your thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-Micah&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2006/11/15/writing-songs-in-my-motel-room/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2006/11/15/writing-songs-in-my-motel-room/</link><pubDate>Wed Nov 15 01:13:00 CST 2006</pubDate><title>Writing Songs in My Motel Room</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>I have this dream...a dream where I am awake in the wee hours of the morning, looking out over the city, writing songs.

In this dream, I live on the edge of the road, and every day means new cities and new experiences, and all I ever have to think about is how to make the most out of my time, how to enjoy my life as much as possible. And I already have the answer. In my dream, I spend my time writing songs, designing cool things, performing on stage, traveling, and exploring the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To me, this is freedom. It's what I dream about when I stand outside at dusk and look up at the sky. It's what it means to me to be "self-employed". If I can make enough money to survive doing the things I love, I will no longer have to split my energy between life and work, because one will be the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the weekend, we traveled up to Peoria, IL, stopping at some fun and interesting places along the way. Like the gas station/motel/apartment/playground that formed the majority of "town-age" at one exit. It was a weird scene, but it was another experience you just can't have sitting at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, on the trip I wrote a new song I'm calling "Shoulder", a song that is one of those stay-up-writing-in-your-motel-room kind of songs. The ones that I dream about. There's just a certain quality from those you don't normally get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I need to work on more normal rock songs, though. Trying to continually develop my song-writing ability tends to make me stray into weirder and weirder styles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Creativity is a constant balancing act. Just something to think about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-micah&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2010/02/01/life-the-multiverse-and-everything/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2010/02/01/life-the-multiverse-and-everything/</link><pubDate>Mon Feb 01 17:44:09 CST 2010</pubDate><title>Life, The Multiverse, and Everything</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>I'm a big believer in the multiverse.

I can't quite explain why, but from the first time I heard the concept, I knew it was true. It just made deep, intuitive sense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I have trouble understanding why most people find it counter-intuitive and troubling, when it fills me with wonder and amazement. But I suppose that is to be expected. New discoveries are always problematic to the world in which they were born. The theory of relativity, the concepts of quantum mechanics, and the idea of the big bang all met with extreme mental resistance when they were introduced. But a generation or so later, most people understand and accept all of these ideas rather intuitively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of us are a little behind on quantum physics, and very few of us have really been introduced to the concept of multiple universes co-existing. But in another generation, not only will these ideas be taken as intuitive, but these ideas will change the way people look at the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can see a new mentality coming; one that rests in its understanding of the vastness of the multiverse, and in that light, lives differently. What I want to do, is to sketch out what that mentality will look like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The vastness of reality&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Copernicus changed our viewpoint on the arrangement of the universe, the 20th century changed our understanding of the vastness of the universe. No longer is the earth or the solar system large in the scheme of things. Instead, we float on the outskirts of a vast galaxy, in a sea of galaxies just as unfathomable, in a universe that is nearly 20 billion light-years across.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just ONE light-year is more than 5,878 billion miles in empty space, more than 65,000 times the distance from the earth to the Sun. So the width of our universe is the distance from the earth to the Sun times 65,000, times 20 billion. Sorry that those numbers don't help much. We inevitably shrink our conception of reality due to our own lack of experience with things that big.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, if you can, try to grasp the vastness of the universe for just a moment. Then turn your mind around and conceive of a beginning point from which everything sprang - not only our universe, not only every variation of our universe, but every variation of the very idea of universe itself. Every being that could ever exist, every world conceivable by human mind, every point throughout infinite space and time, not only exists, but exists in vastness so unfathomable as to stun the very sense of existence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All that exists stretches &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; high above us; and when it reaches the top of our perception - it stretches for an infinity of worlds beyond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The nature of existence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout human history, the quiet debate has raged, asking:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is the world caring, or heartless? Is it cruel, or gentle?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the suffering in the world has encouraged many to label it violent and evil, the realization that we are small in the order of things has only intensified that perception. What has gone so largely unnoticed is that &lt;em&gt;existence itself&lt;/em&gt; bends towards creation, proliferation, diversity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A beautiful theology in the middle ages was called The Great Chain of Being. The idea was that God was loving, and a loving being all by himself is compelled to create something which it can love. But God, being &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt;-loving, couldn't just create one thing; instead, he created everything which &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be loved, from the single-celled organisms which can fathom nothing, to humans who can contemplate their own existence, to beings of ever greater capability and complexity...the chain stretching all the way from nothingness up to very God himself. The concept was that if God &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt;, then he was infinitely loving, and infinitely creative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the idea fell out of favor when it was realized there were gaps in the animal kingdom. The chain was apparently missing a few links, and so dropped out of the limelight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But we now know that the chain &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; exist, and &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; stretch all the way from nothingness up to infinity, including in it every being which could ever be loved, in this universe or in any other. The nature of existence is creation, is giving life; and the primary thing which existence &lt;em&gt;exists to do&lt;/em&gt;, is to give life to every being possible!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Things are sometimes hard, and suffering is real. But beneath it all is the great river of existence, giving life to everything which can be named, from here to infinity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Living beyond choice and fate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For centuries, people have argued over free will and determinism. The most reasonable proponents of free will have admitted that the world is probably a mixture of the two, while most determinists have argued that the very concept of free will makes no sense. After all, everything in this world has a cause, and if we could know the cause fully enough, we could know with absolute certainty what would happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The advent of quantum physics shook up the balance a little, suggesting that not only are there things that seem to behave randomly, but there are things that are ultimately unknowable. Still, determinism held on strongly in both philosophy and science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contemplating life in the multiverse will require going beyond this dichotomy between free will and determinism. It turns out there is both choice and fate, and not in tension; in the multiverse determinism is precisely what gives rise to free will. Classical determinism supposed that there was one universe and one history, determined in a single line from beginning to end; the multiverse shows us that what is predetermined is the existence of every possibility, every history, every possible choice a person could make. And so the deterministic equations unroll, continually unleashing new possibilities and choices by the literal infinities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new sense of identity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, a person's sense of identity was held to be the one constant that remained unchanged throughout their life. But the past hundred years has challenged this significantly. From geographical mobility to the collision and diffusion of cultures, from the breakdown of racial divisions to the changing roles of people within society, from new theories of human origins to new understandings of the mind and the brain, people are faced with a more complex sense of identity than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We now understand that a person's body is constantly changing its composition. We now understand that a mind is constantly changing too; and we've seen people with split brains, multiple personalities, and all kinds of conceptions of who they are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are two directions we can move. On the one hand, we can affirm that there is something at our core that is the true &lt;em&gt;us&lt;/em&gt;, that is deeper than our bodies, our thoughts, and our emotions. We can shrink the boundaries of self to this perfect, shiny point; nothing that extends outwards from it is truly part of it. It is pure and alone. So we are ourselves, whether we lose hands or feet or skin cells or even memories; the center-point of self remains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, we can affirm that our &lt;em&gt;self&lt;/em&gt; is messy and inclusive. We can extend the boundaries of our self to include the past versions of ourself, with our former perceptions and personality traits. We can extend the boundaries of our self to include future selves, and selves that could have been. We can extend the boundaries of our self to encompass the infinite branching tree of existence that starts at our creation, and stretches all the way to the end of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end, I think either direction brings us around to the same place. Much like seeing in 3D, our perception of self in the future will have to involve maintaining a dual focus on the central moment of awareness, and the vast expanse of what we ultimately encompass.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2007/08/01/4-months-of-songs-of-the-week/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2007/08/01/4-months-of-songs-of-the-week/</link><pubDate>Wed Aug 01 05:27:00 CDT 2007</pubDate><title>4 MONTHS of Songs of The Week!</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>If you haven't noticed yet, we've just completed FOUR MONTHS of writing, recording, and releasing one new song every week - every Saturday at midnight.

Away to a new home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was an 8-foot by 8-foot, self-supported, huge cardboard poster of the new Miami Vice movie. We got it from the Teays Valley Cinemas as a victory trophy after our last concert there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doretta had packed it into the back of her small car (it had to be taken apart BOLT by BOLT), and driven it over 300 miles to get it to us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It stood up in our apartment as a &lt;a href="http://www.reddingbrothers.com/"&gt;beacon of awesomeness&lt;/a&gt; and an icon of cool. It inspired us to create our own 6-foot by 8-foot poster, hang it on the front of the Miami Vice structure, and then drive the whole thing several states away to display proudly in the midst of Birmingham, Alabama.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But taking it down and putting it back up was a monumental under-taking. It probably had 100 bolts, 50 flaps that had to be inserted, and 40 different parts that had to be kept track of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then we discovered that we could just hang our banner on some posts, and not carry the Miami Vice poster across the US. So the Miami Vice poster was relegated to being setup in our apartment, displaying its awesomeness out the front window, to the world below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, as all things do, this eventually caused us to run out of room. Between the TWO drumsets, the musical equipment, a dining room table, and something that Gabe created out of foam that looks like a skate-ramp, there was simply no space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So it had to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately, we found a good home for it. A guy living in ultra-small-town Tennessee who loved the movie. (I haven't even seen the movie; the poster was awesome enough for me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So today it was packed up into the back of another small car, and driven across the country-side. It was only fitting that today on Myspace, we release a &lt;a href="http://www.myspace.com/reddingbrothers"&gt;song commemorating its exodus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Farewell, ultra-large Miami Vice poster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-micah&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;span class="technoratitag"&gt;Technorati Tags:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/songs" target="_blank" rel="tag" title="Link to Technorati Tag category for songs"&gt;songs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/christmas" target="_blank" rel="tag" title="Link to Technorati Tag category for christmas"&gt;christmas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/movies" target="_blank" rel="tag" title="Link to Technorati Tag category for movies"&gt;movies&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/miami+vice" target="_blank" rel="tag" title="Link to Technorati Tag category for miami vice"&gt;miami vice&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/fun" target="_blank" rel="tag" title="Link to Technorati Tag category for fun"&gt;fun&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/band" target="_blank" rel="tag" title="Link to Technorati Tag category for band"&gt;band&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/music" target="_blank" rel="tag" title="Link to Technorati Tag category for music"&gt;music&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2005/05/21/adventure-in-dayton/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2005/05/21/adventure-in-dayton/</link><pubDate>Sat May 21 18:51:00 CDT 2005</pubDate><title>Adventure in Dayton</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>Last night was our Dayton Borders Cafe show...though *some* band members thought it was the Attic Club show (scheduled for tonight, not last night) and went to the completely wrong side of town.

Micah drove up from our soon-to-be new headquarters of Nashville, TN, while Gabe and I came from Scott Depot, WV...forgetting to bring a cellphone, map, or any other kind of useful tool that you would normally think to bring on a trip. But eventually, after purchasing a phone card from a local CVS and buying an oversized map, me and Gabe found our way to the Borders Cafe and had a great show. Our pals from Dayton University showed up and we hung out after the show talking about our past adventures with car breakdowns and freaky old men. I think we almost convinced them to move to Nashville with us and rent an OCTOPLEX (duplex x 4 = octoplex)...sorry...inside joke :-). Anyway, we had a fun show last night. We'll see everyone tonight at the Attic Club. -Siah&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2005/05/02/movie-primer/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2005/05/02/movie-primer/</link><pubDate>Mon May 02 10:00:00 CDT 2005</pubDate><title>MOVIE - Primer</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>Great movie.

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In attempting to synthesize this many unique perspectives, there is an undeniable backlog of contradictory thoughts and insights. But instead of focusing on the conflicts, I have been drawn to the synchronicities, the areas where all seem to be coalescing on a joint vision. This, it seems to me, is indication of a deep layer of truth that is being dug up in many forms and in various ways. My expression of these ideas is my own such effort, an attempt to convey the gist of all of this in a quick narrative form. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Press any of my points too hard, and it will undoubtably break. My hope is that you can see the forest despite the trees, and be moved to deeper investigation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note on my use of the term "human sacrifice":&lt;/strong&gt; In using this term, I am intending to specify more than just the obvious human sacrifices. I am including all redemptive violence, all killings which are falsely purported to restore peace and justice to the world.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/11/25/influential-books-movies/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/11/25/influential-books-movies/</link><pubDate>Sun Nov 25 17:44:51 CST 2012</pubDate><title>Influential books &amp; movies</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>"Kingdoms of the wall" - a novel about meeting the gods at the top of a mountain

I think that's incorrect. It fails to account for prevailing interest in deities and the afterlife, it fails to address the particular ways people approach their religious views.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No, religion is not concerned with ethics, it's concerned with &lt;em&gt;justice&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Justice is about how things get set right. Ethics are about how we side with justice, but justice itself, the language and breath of religion, draws us into thinking about humanity and transcendance and immortality. Our pursuit of justice leads us to religion, and our pursuit of justice leads us beyond it.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2004/07/24/dayton-invasion-07232004/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2004/07/24/dayton-invasion-07232004/</link><pubDate>Sat Jul 24 02:26:00 CDT 2004</pubDate><title>Dayton Invasion - 07/23/2004</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>A new state experienced the noisy force of the Redding Brothers, as they expanded their regular performance locations into the Ohio area, beginning at a local Borders store in Dayton.

Why? Because you know this story. It’s been told over and over and over, for at least as long as we’ve been making movies. Consider the 1927 film [Metropolis](&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolis_(1927_film))"&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolis_(1927_film))&lt;/a&gt;, or the 1895 novel &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Time_Machine"&gt;The Time Machine&lt;/a&gt;. We know it so well, that even just a glimpse of a seemingly-perfect society on-screen will tip us off that we’re about to discover a seedy underbelly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Elysium&lt;/em&gt;, the seediness is upfront, and isn’t hidden in any way. But in a lot of stories, it’s hiding, and we’re supposed to be surprised when we discover that the too-perfect world of the surface conceals much darker things beneath it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Except, we’re not surprised. We know how this story plays out, and we’ve been telling it to ourselves over and over for generations. It’s as if long ago we got burned, and then vowed to never let ourselves be fooled again. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is so ingrained that when a story about human improvement (like &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqMe6pwSfIE"&gt;Limitless&lt;/a&gt;) doesn’t end in tragedy, we’re stunned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stories aren’t the only place where this shows up. I hear it when people discuss practical things we could do to make the world better. The very fact that we could talk about significant positive change seems to make some people feel as if the wool is being pulled over their eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sadly, some people even feel this way about their own lives — that if something good seems possible, it must be a trap. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the majority seem to be coming at this from a more troubling angle: they strongly believe in pursuing good things for themselves — but they think that pursuing good things for the world is a pipe dream. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In taking that stance, they might feel like they are fighting the power, sticking it to the man, rebelling against the system. They might feel like they are contradicting the majority narrative, or debunking the myth of progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But actually, all of that is just upholding the mainstream stance of apathy, and working to silence the small groups of people who are making deep personal sacrifices to create positive change. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a world where optimism itself is shameful, a story where things turn out all right is revolutionary.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2004/11/16/gabe-back-safe-and-unsound-mentally-that-is/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2004/11/16/gabe-back-safe-and-unsound-mentally-that-is/</link><pubDate>Tue Nov 16 03:06:00 CST 2004</pubDate><title>Gabe back safe and unsound (mentally, that is)</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>Well, our concert on Saturday went well, we had a lot of fun, and Gabe finally got back - a day late, and a dollar short - as the saying goes.

Modes are at fault when you miss a call because your phones in silent mode. And there's little worse than having the final bars of Appalachian Spring – with harmonies as delicate as frozen cobwebs – thrashed by a cellphone who's owner has forgot to put it into silent mode. Perhaps there is something worse: having it be &lt;i&gt;your&lt;/i&gt; cellphone. You can read all about modes, modes errors, catastrophic mistakes, and some solutions in our article &lt;a href="http://www.humanized.com/weblog/2006/12/07/is_visual_feedback_enough_why_modes_kill/"&gt;Visual Feedback: Why Modes Kill&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the challenge:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Is it possible to design a car that isn't forward/reverse modal? If it isn't possible, why? And if it is possible, how?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;What he's asking is, can we make a car that can reverse or go forward, but NOT USE THE SAME PEDAL TO DO BOTH. Using the same pedal for both leads to all kinds of problems for us humans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I went to post my answer, but their comment system wouldn't let me, so here it is for you:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make the steering wheel control acceleration and deceleration. As it is pushed/tilted forwards, it accelerates the car. As it is pulled/tilted backwards, it decelerates the car. Deceleration is understood to be the same as thrust in the rearward direction, and so reverses the car when applied enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don't think this would be modal, because it coincides with a fairly common mental model. However, if it would be, then this clarification should fix it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make a stick similar to a gear shift, positioned to the right of the driver. There are three positions: forward, centered, and backwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pushing the stick forward accelerates the car to a degree proportional to its forward position. Pulling it back towards the center slows it down to a stop. Pulling it back past the center towards the back of the car reverses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If needed in order to prevent accidental damage, there can be a button on the handle that must be pressed before the stick can go into the reverse position.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Either way, this is not modal because the stick's position ALWAYS correlates to the same action of the car.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-micah&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/design" rel="tag"&gt;design&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/interface" rel="tag"&gt;interface&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/cars" rel="tag"&gt;cars&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/brakes" rel="tag"&gt;brakes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/puzzles" rel="tag"&gt;puzzles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/puzzlers" rel="tag"&gt;puzzlers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2008/02/06/politics-again/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2008/02/06/politics-again/</link><pubDate>Wed Feb 06 16:20:00 CST 2008</pubDate><title>Politics, again</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>I apologize if I offended anyone with my last couple of posts.

I wasn't trying to paint a bleak or pessimistic picture; I'm very optimistic about humanity. But I felt the need  to testify to the truth as I see it in this one area.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Nor was I trying to say that all politicians are evil. Doubtless, many have approached politics with the sincere desire to do good.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;It's just that I don't believe politicians anymore. The higher you ascend the political tower, the less and less sincere you become. You can tell that the presidential candidates are not honest or sincere people. Or if they are, it's been buried beneath the advice of their political advisors. I would normally not say that about anyone ... but actions speak.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I do believe in working for good in whatever situation you are in. But I also believe that if you're going to be a bull-fighter, you should expect to be gored. Certain things just go together, like politics and corruption.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;For what it's worth, Ron Paul and Barak Obama seem to be the most sincere of the candidates.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;-Micah Redding&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2011/09/21/why-i-joined-mormon-trashumanist-association/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2011/09/21/why-i-joined-mormon-trashumanist-association/</link><pubDate>Wed Sep 21 21:46:55 CDT 2011</pubDate><title>Why I joined the Mormon Transhumanist Association</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>Recently, I've become convinced that *the singularity is upon us*.

I don't mean this in the sense of an impending mass human upload, or a cyborg takeover, or some other apocalyptic scenario; I mean that the pace of change has reached a point where we can now &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; it, where it has now begun to impact the way we think about ourselves and our future. Every year is faster than the one before, and as change speeds up, our very conception of humanity is shifting underneath us. The faster change happens, the more the future becomes a constant companion, a force that is continually pressuring and altering us. The future becomes present, threatening to redefine us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We find ourselves living in groundlessness. But how do we navigate groundless existence?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Often, we turn to our favorite spiritual or religious philosophy, and increasingly, we find them coming up short. They offer no answers to the big questions of modern and postmodern life, not because they don't &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; the answers, but because the guardians and communicators of these traditions have no ability or interest in finding the kind of answers most needed. And when confronting something like the massive oncoming changes, the reaction is usually one of dismissal, or intense reaction, or simple ignorance that anything is happening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The few people that are actively engaging with future trajectories are usually drawn from the transhumanist frontlines - atheists with little patience for the kind of spiritual sensibility most of humanity considers essential. The very few individuals exploring the intersection of Christianity and transhumanism are usually interfacing with both sets of ideas on a very shallow level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not very satisfying, all the way around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our spiritual traditions cannot keep ignoring the oncoming changes, nor can they sustain reactionary approaches. Those of us with deep spiritual convictions need to begin processing the future, and helping others to do so. And the only people who seem to be doing that on any kind of sustained level are the Mormons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, after some discussion, I joined the Mormon Transhumanist Association. I'm not a Mormon, but the &lt;a href="http://transfigurism.org/pages/about/mormon-transhumanist-affirmation/"&gt;statement of affirmation&lt;/a&gt; posed no problem for me, and most importantly, in the MTA I found a community of people beginning to engage with these ideas openly and without fear. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hope together, we can help provoke discussion in the larger world. And I hope we can help religious and spiritual groups navigate the road ahead in a healthier way than they've often done in the past.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2014/08/31/aspirations/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2014/08/31/aspirations/</link><pubDate>Sun Aug 31 23:06:17 CDT 2014</pubDate><title>Aspirations</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>I hear a lot about how our society sells us on consumerist wants, how magazines convince us we look ugly and need to look better, how car commercials make us lust after cars we don’t need, how our who...</description><content:encoded>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I hear a lot about how our society sells us on consumerist wants, how magazines convince us we look ugly and need to look better, how car commercials make us lust after cars we don’t need, how our whole economy is premised on the empty ideal of keeping up with the Joneses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This concept has even been extended to Facebook. Facebook, studies say, makes us unhappy by showing other people at their best. This makes us feel like our lives are worse than they are, and we become dissatisfied and unhappy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m sure all this is true, and is a valid critique of our culture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there are few times when I’ve felt happier than when I had something big and ambitious to aspire to. In fact, one of my chief disappointments in growing older is that society hasn’t risen to the challenge of giving me new things to base my aspirations on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, the aspirations I picked up on weren’t things like “have a bigger house”, or “drive a nicer car”. They were more like, “be an epic swordsmen and start your own airline”, or “speak twelve languages and go rock-climbing on the weekends”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, after being drawn in by all the aspirational lifestyles the magazines were selling, one of the first aspirations I actually ever developed for myself was to be a magazine publisher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These kinds of aspirations didn’t leave me dissatisfied with my life. Instead, because I knew I could jump in and work towards them, they gave me meaning and purpose, a sense of open-ended possibility, and a pulsing creative energy. They didn’t limit me to some predefined rat race; they showed me the doorway to greater and grander things than I had yet imagined.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2006/11/26/my-thanks-to-you/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2006/11/26/my-thanks-to-you/</link><pubDate>Sun Nov 26 19:37:00 CST 2006</pubDate><title>My Thanks to You</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>This weekend was Thanksgiving.

It's funny how we feel the need to have holidays for those things we should be doing all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that in mind, I wanted to express my gratitude to everyone who's ever...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Listened to &lt;a href="http://www.reddingbrothers.com/"&gt;our album&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Shared our album with your friends&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Come to our concerts&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Spent time on our &lt;a href="http://www.reddingbrothers.com/"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Read &lt;a href="http://www.micahredding.com/"&gt;this blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Encouraged me to keep going&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Sent me some honest feedback - good or bad&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You are what make my dreams possible.

Time to hit publish. :) -Micah&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year, for me, is Year Zero. Why?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, one good reason is that it's year zero of the new decade. Calendar nerds will tell you that 2010 is NOT the first year of a new decade, but the last year of the decade that stretched from 2001-present. These are the same people who told us the new millennium didn't start in 2000, but in &lt;em&gt;2001&lt;/em&gt;, a year later. After all, they gloat, there is no year zero AD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They are correct, our calendar transitions from 1 BC to 1 AD, leaving no room for year zero, a fact which continues to irk me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that's beside the point. 2010 turned over the digits in our calendar, driving home the fact that we are now quite removed from the year 2000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For me, there's a stranger reason. I'm 28, and will be for most of 2010. And when my dad was 28, I was born.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means that from here on out, I can begin to remember what my dad was like at my age. Or, a weirder way to put it, if I was my dad, the child-version of me would be age zero right now. The significant thing is that I once had a very specific perspective on someone who was 30, 35, 40 - and now I have reached the point where I can begin to be that person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's zero-point for me in other ways as well. I've been a working musician for 7 years now. For me, seven years seems like it means something. Just like a week - after 7 days, everything starts over. And then things are reborn, things are transformed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everything is starting over, and who knows what that will mean?&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2007/09/24/kings-among-stars/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2007/09/24/kings-among-stars/</link><pubDate>Mon Sep 24 19:07:00 CDT 2007</pubDate><title>Kings among Stars</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>This weekend, I was in Iowa City, Iowa for a conference in which hundreds of college students from tons of colleges gather to find entertainment to bring to their campuses.

For the entire weekend, performers of all kinds would showcase their talents in the hope of being chosen. A select few (such as myself) would be allowed to play a concert in front of these students.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One conversation I had stuck with me. "We all lead other lives," a hypnotist told me, "we're all just trying to stay in this one as long as possible". By day, she was a therapist. By night, a hypnotic stage performer and magnificent entertainer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When she said that, I looked around me, and what I saw reminded me of a line from the movie "Almost Famous":&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"This is the circus, everybody's trying not to go home."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She was right. Everyone did lead other lives. That weekend, I saw magicians who mystified and comedians who owned the stage; and as long as they're there, they have the magic. But then they go home to their mother's basement, and normal life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's the same way for the college students who are there to book these acts. For that weekend only, rock stars and television celebrities would cater to these kids like no one else. At no other time in these kids lives will they feel so close to stardom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On Monday, they're back to dorm life and ramen noodles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for the weekend, they are kings in a world of entertainers.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/04/11/miracles-and-anthropic-principle/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/04/11/miracles-and-anthropic-principle/</link><pubDate>Wed Apr 11 01:06:42 CDT 2012</pubDate><title>Miracles and the Anthropic Principle</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>The universe appears to have been fine-tuned for life.

The physical constants (like the strength of gravity or the number of spatial dimensions) seem to have really improbable values, and those values just happen to be precisely the ones which allow creatures like us to exist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropic_principle"&gt;Anthropic Principle&lt;/a&gt; states that this is to be expected - after all, if the universe &lt;em&gt;weren't&lt;/em&gt; fine-tuned for life, then we wouldn't be here to observe it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, that's not an explanation, just a statement. It doesn't tell us &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; the universe came to be fine-tuned, just that we should &lt;em&gt;expect&lt;/em&gt; it to be. Since we are here observing the past, we should expect to see the past "conspiring" to bring us to this point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So let's take this idea a little farther. If the human race is fragile (as it seems to be), then we should expect to see many close calls in our history. But for all of those close calls, we should also expect to see improbably heroic escapes. After all, if we &lt;em&gt;didn't&lt;/em&gt; heroically escape, we wouldn't be here. [^1]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This idea has some consequences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For one, we should expect to see greater numbers of these improbable events clustered around turning points in history. The more significant (dangerous) the turning point is, the more we should expect to see improbable events cluster around it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, we might even be able to use improbable events as a way of pinpointing otherwise unnoticed "close calls" for humanity. Similarly, we could use extremely unlikely physical constants to identify previously unknown requirements for life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further, as human life becomes more robust and resistant to danger, we should expect to see the occurrence of these improbable events drop dramatically. Not only would improbable events decrease over time, but looking back, we should see a "heroic age" in which many improbable things happened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let's make this concrete.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let's suppose that Moses crossed the Red Sea just like Exodus describes. According to the text, Moses and the Israelites were fleeing from the Egyptians, and then found themselves trapped between the armies of Egypt and the sea. There was no way out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's when a strong wind began to blow. It blew all night, beating back the water, opening up a pathway for them to cross on dry ground. They crossed the sea, escaped the Egyptians, and survived.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people have proposed theories about how this could have happened naturally, and in fact, there is nothing in this account that violates the laws of physics. But for it to have happened at precisely that crucial moment in Israelite history is staggeringly improbable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unless it &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; to. If the survival of the Israelite people was crucial to human survival and existence today, then no matter how improbable that event was, it is exactly the kind of thing we should expect to see.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later on, when the Israelite people became more established, we would expect to see fewer such events. And at whatever point their national existence stopped being crucial to human survival, those events would stop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please note that I'm &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; saying this &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the case. I don't have any way to establish this kind of connection between human survival and ancient Israel. And I'm not a textual expert - I can't speak to whether this account records a historic event or not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if we &lt;em&gt;were&lt;/em&gt; pretty certain that something like this happened, then it would be good evidence that this moment in history was crucial to the survival of humanity as a whole. And conversely, if we were pretty sure that the Israelites were instrumental in the survival of humanity as a whole, then we would have good reason to suspect that these sorts of accounts were more than mythology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can apply this to any culture or miraculous claim. Just as with the Anthropic Principle, we have no answer as to &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; these things might happen. All we have is a suggestion of where to look, and of how to interpret what we find. [^2]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;[^1]: Of course, an alternative is that we never experience close calls at all. I'm not sure how to measure the probability of &lt;em&gt;never experiencing a close call&lt;/em&gt;, so I'll leave that thought experiment up to you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[^2]: In the end, miracle stories could hold a truly practical value. By highlighting close calls in our history, they could alert us to dangers we might otherwise never have noticed, and looming threats that we may still have to face.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2011/08/24/tools/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2011/08/24/tools/</link><pubDate>Wed Aug 24 12:41:15 CDT 2011</pubDate><title>Tools</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>Tools for your digital life

In philosophical and theological circles, &lt;em&gt;human&lt;/em&gt; is often used as a synonym for &lt;em&gt;limited&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This, I think, is weak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, it’s true that we are limited. At any given moment, we have constraints on our action, and are forced to make choices between different outcomes, based on the energy and resources we have at our disposal. We are always making decisions under duress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, to listen to mythology and theology, this is also the situation of the gods. It is the fate of all beings; divinity doesn’t get a free pass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what makes us human is not fundamentally a contrast with the divine. The contrast must be with something else, something much closer to home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This past month I’ve been walking every morning. I spend a lot of time in a mental world — thinking, writing, coding — and walking makes me feel a little more in touch with aspects of myself that tend to fade from view. I enjoy the feeling of stretching my legs, venturing out into the world, taking on a little of the elements, experiencing the sense that I could keep going, that other places are within reach. It reconnects me to my trips overseas, to my childhood spent hiking through the woods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And I often summarize this by saying that it makes me feel more human. And by that, I mean that it makes me feel less one-dimensional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being human, I think, is being nuanced. It is being complex and layered. It is having connections with our body, our selves, and the world around us. It is answering to hunger, and being compelled to write.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This complex of nested relationships that we live in imposes a lot on us. It’s easy to see that as being limited, or operating under constraints. But what it really is, I think, is an insistence that we don’t live in just one area, defined by our jobs or our family or our thoughts. We live in a wide-open world, and we are beings built to be just as open, just as nuanced and nested and deep, as everything around us.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2005/02/13/morp-hurricane-highschool/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2005/02/13/morp-hurricane-highschool/</link><pubDate>Sun Feb 13 14:00:00 CST 2005</pubDate><title>MORP @ Hurricane Highschool</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>Gotta say it, MORP was awesome.

Although it's a very simple argument, the mental contortions one has to jump through make it difficult for many people to grasp. So let me recap and generalize a little.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If there are intelligent beings&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;And if they create simulations&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Then simulated worlds will outnumber non-simulated worlds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fairly simple so far, right? Okay, let's make it personal:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If simulated worlds outnumber non-simulated worlds&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;And if we can't tell the difference&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Then we should assume we're in a simulation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's the tough step for most people, and leaves you working back through the chain of arguments to see where things went wrong. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For most people, the part where it goes wrong is the idea that we can't tell the difference between a simulated world, and a non-simulated world. But that's our usage of the word "simulation" here. We're assuming that with the right technology and skill, someone could create a simulation so real, the participants wouldn't be able to tell the difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may question whether that would even be possible. In that case, we're back to step 2, "...And if they create simulations". &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This step hinges on intelligent entities being &lt;em&gt;able&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;willing&lt;/em&gt; to create the simulations. If they die out before they figure out how to do so, then they're not able. If they have the capability, but somehow choose to never create any simulations, then they're not willing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But keep in mind what we're saying. Just &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; simulated worlds would make the Simulation Argument valid. Just &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; simulations in &lt;em&gt;all of history&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're saying that these simulations will never happen, you're saying that for the next trillion years, no intelligent being will ever create a realistic simulated world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given how realistic our simulations are getting these days, it seems to me that if no one ever creates a fully realistic simulation, it's because something pretty drastic happens. So...are you feeling lucky?&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2008/04/02/what-is-community/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2008/04/02/what-is-community/</link><pubDate>Wed Apr 02 23:12:00 CDT 2008</pubDate><title>What is Community?</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>What IS community?This is something that I'm going to be thinking about for awhile.Community has traditionally referred to a geographically integrated group of people.

This kind of community shares common experiences and habits. They shop at the same grocery store, send their kids to the same school, have some relatives in common, and share the same basic world-view and outlook on life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This kind of community started fraying at the edges when Christianity was introduced. Christianity originated as a small persecuted group, not at home in either the Jewish or the Roman world, and so Christians explicitly believed that an individual might hold a radically different belief-system than their community. Further, Christians saw themselves as part of a community that transcended location.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So Christianity introduced the concept of community built on values rather than history. But this concept is a hard one, and if you are no longer a small, persecuted group, it is probably too vague to put into practice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It wasn't until the 20th century that the traditional type of community really started to fall apart. Mobility and technology reshaped the world, so that people were no longer tied down to an ancestral village, state, or nation. Travel became a common right, rather than an exotic adventure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the 21st century, this has practically demolished the traditional idea of community. Next-door neighbors no longer have much in common, or share much conversation. Cities allow people to choose dramatically different traditions and styles of living. Community as something centralized by geography has almost disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people look to online community to take up the slack. For many of us plagued with wildly untraditional ideas, it has ended our sense of isolation, and helped us to find a sense of legitimacy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Others look to local churches to take on the mantle of community. Many people develop important relationships through their affiliation with a particular church.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what IS community?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it shared location? Shared experiences?

It's a film based on the many lives of Bob Dylan, who is played by six different characters, including Kate Blanchett. I 'm not enough of a Dylan expert to feel qualified to evaluate the movie, but it sparked several thoughts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Chaos is Key&lt;/span&gt;. The universe exists on the edge of order and chaos. The artist is the one who travels farther over the edge than anyone else, and brings part of his experience back. The revolutionary is the one who brings the chaos back with him. When Bob Dylan went electric at the height of his folk popularity, he found a way to introduce chaos into his world. From listening to him, it seems that this was his intention. Chaos is both destructive and constructive: it tears down the forms of the old, so that something new and unexpected may result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;There is no "End"&lt;/span&gt;. We deceive ourselves into seeing ourselves heading towards a climax. Perhaps that is the only way we can see things; but once there, we discover that our climax was only a local maximum on the road of history. The movie (perhaps unwittingly) made this point through several false endings, both in the individual characters' lives, and in the movie as a whole. One character dodges a bullet and escapes to the hills, to live a reclusive life as a vanished legend. We've seen this story before; he goes out in a blaze of glory, but secretly he survives and vanishes into a cloud of dust. And his story is supposed to be over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But life is not a fairy tale, and no matter how much legend we've created for ourselves, life must go on, and our character (no matter how much he tells himself otherwise) will continue to adventure and travel and run from the law.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many in America saw their world coming to an end in the 1960s. Everything was falling out of wack: between hippies and war, assassinations and corruption, the world seemed like it was falling apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But life goes on, and so after the cultural apocalypse of the 60s and 70s, you have the 80s and 90s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Humans are so used to expecting an end. Living in a world &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;without end&lt;/span&gt; requires new ways of approaching life.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2014/09/16/christianity-set-memes/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2014/09/16/christianity-set-memes/</link><pubDate>Tue Sep 16 23:12:30 CDT 2014</pubDate><title>Christianity is a set of memes</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>I’m a Christian.

That means that I think that a certain set of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme"&gt;memes&lt;/a&gt; — memes which started in first-century Israel, and very quickly spread out into the rest of the world — are very significant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As time went on, those memes profoundly reshaped the world we live in. Some of the people who proclaimed those memes did terrible, horrific things. Some of the people who proclaimed those memes did incredible, beautiful things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I suspect that the incredible, beautiful things have outweighed the terrible, horrific things. But much more significantly, I suspect that the memes themselves have impacted us more positively than negatively. I suspect that many of the amazing things we take for granted in the world today, owe their existence to those memes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I talk about the value of Christianity, I am referring to the impact of those memes. That impact extends far beyond the bounds of organized religion and Christian proclamation. In fact, it’s possible that organized Christianity might be a minuscule part of their ultimate impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m a Christian, and that means that I think that a certain set of memes are very significant, have changed our world for the better, and will most likely continue to impact our world in new and surprising and profound ways.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2006/05/07/clouds-lyrics-2/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2006/05/07/clouds-lyrics-2/</link><pubDate>Sun May 07 17:37:00 CDT 2006</pubDate><title>Clouds Lyrics</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>Clouds (w:m micah redding)A long time ago, a nation very far awayYoung men stood on a hillside, dreaming of another dayThey never knew what this would lead to, all these visions, all these thingsAll t...</description><content:encoded>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Clouds (w:m micah redding)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A long time ago, a nation very far away&lt;br /&gt;Young men stood on a hillside, dreaming of another day&lt;br /&gt;They never knew what this would lead to, all these visions, all these things&lt;br /&gt;All they knew was that they'd never lose the power of the dream&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And now a thousand years later, and a million miles since&lt;br /&gt;You can still hear them coming, hear their voices in the wind, they're singing&lt;br /&gt;A million different cities where the people cried aloud&lt;br /&gt;You could hear the changes coming in the clouds&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;[It came in the clouds that day&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Blowing open heaven's gates&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Coming in on the winds of change&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;The day it all came down&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;That day was filled with clouds]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They saw a new heaven and earth, a new birth, new universe, born right here on the earth&lt;br /&gt;They knew that if this was to happen everything would have to change&lt;br /&gt;They'd bring the revolution and the day&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;[chorus]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The change they knew was coming never took them by surprise&lt;br /&gt;But lifted them unspoken with the winds into the skies&lt;br /&gt;And now you can hear their voices, all eternity they cry&lt;br /&gt;Immortal they're a beacon in the sky&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;[chorus]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2006/11/28/redding-brothers-the-fantastic-anti-gravity-device/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2006/11/28/redding-brothers-the-fantastic-anti-gravity-device/</link><pubDate>Tue Nov 28 14:28:00 CST 2006</pubDate><title>Redding Brothers - The Fantastic Anti-Gravity Device!</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>You may have realized that the Redding Brothers are a little eccentric.

What you may not have realized is how deep this really goes. For example, while other families were wasting their time this past weekend on food and football, my family decided to do something a little different for Thanksgiving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We decided to create an Anti-Gravity Device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Device would be built from:&lt;br /&gt;an old TV&lt;br /&gt;a soda bottle&lt;br /&gt;some wire&lt;br /&gt;and some aluminum foil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm not even making this up. My dad and brothers spent hours laboring in the garage, creating huge arcs of electricity, generating interesting noises, and causing the TV to spontaneously come on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was our Thanksgiving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What's even more amazing is that this really should have worked. Unfortunately, my family chose to use an old TV, when it really should have been an old computer monitor. Silly family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The power supply in a TV is OBVIOUSLY not as high-quality as it needs to be to create Anti-gravity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-micah&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.reddingbrothers.com/"&gt;http://www.reddingbrothers.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS.

At root, I said, transhumanism is the idea that we can make things better. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One comment suggested that I should add an important qualifier: transhumanism is the idea that we can make things better &lt;em&gt;through science and technology&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I agree that this is the main distinguishing factor of modern transhumanism. In fact, when we encounter older transhumanism*s*, or expressions of transhumanism not focused on technology, we usually think of them as religions. There are some groups of people today, for example, who believe they can make the world better through mysticism. There are others who believe they can make the world better through politics. Transhumanists are usually thought of as the people who focus on making the world better through technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So let’s accept this definition. Transhumanism is about making the world better through technology. But what is technology?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his book &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0143120174/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0143120174&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=micahredding-20&amp;linkId=ZFNQ74OKDJHPR7TA"&gt;What Technology Wants&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, Kevin Kelley coins the idea of “the technium”. The technium, he says, is the complete ecosystem of things which have physical presence, and yet which trace their roots to the mind of man. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This includes planes, trains, and automobiles, but it also includes every piece of art ever created, every book ever written, every song ever composed. It includes spoken language, the alphabet, the American justice system, the suit and tie, corporate board meetings, agriculture, farms, fireplaces, Christmas, graffiti, the banana, corn, the poodle, punk rock, treehouses, roads, rope, stories, the Magna Carta, numerals, and the metric system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of these things are &lt;em&gt;technology&lt;/em&gt;, because they were all created through the application of ingenuity and effort. They began as concepts, creative ideas in human minds, and then spread into the world as physical entities taking shape and shaping their surroundings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, technology is thought of as the application of science. But in actuality, science itself is a technology, a tool which allows us to harvest knowledge from the world, and refine it into comprehensible forms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even organized religion, in this broad sense, is a technology. It has buildings and meeting times, mechanisms for communicating important information, songs and sayings, a shared culture, bulletins and church signs and books. It makes use of air travel and roadways to spread the message, it makes use of microphones and meeting halls to keep the community feeling in sync.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technology is not something new, certainly not something foreign. It is intrinsic to who we are as human beings. We are &lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/2013/06/07/iron-man-and-modern-identity-crisis"&gt;inventors and builders&lt;/a&gt;, we create things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you set an ant down in the forest, it will construct an anthill. If you set a human down in the forest, it will begin to construct a technological civilization. It will start with fire, move to shelter, clothing, and then art. Soon it will have built weapons and gardening implements, and begun construction of a small farm. Give it a few generations, and it will have built a village, or even a city. Very quickly, these human beings will be writing music, history, and philosophy — and most of all, telling stories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stories are perhaps the most important technology of all. They imagine alternate worlds, alternate choices, alternate possibilities. They invite us to experience the world through other eyes and other hands. They compel us to step outside of ourselves, and contemplate how things could be different. They give us a sense of past, a sense of present, a sense of future. They create loyalty and honor and courage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stories are the engine of human change. Stories are the fuel of our ongoing development. Without stories, we would not be human in any recognizable sense. Without stories, we would not be able to shape our world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So technology is not the shiny new Apple watch. Technology is not the internet or your laptop computer. Technology is the set of things we have created, the work we have done, the ingenuity we have applied to the world around us. Or, to sum it up: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technology is every technique, method, or system created by the human mind in order to make the world better.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2013/08/03/leaving-church/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2013/08/03/leaving-church/</link><pubDate>Sat Aug 03 14:11:28 CDT 2013</pubDate><title>Leaving the Church</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>Two of the most significant articles I’ve read recently address the question of why millennials are leaving the church.

First, there was this piece by Rachel Evans:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2013/07/27/why-millennials-are-leaving-the-church/"&gt;Why millennials are leaving the church&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then, this by Justin Hanvey:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://andnowdeepthoughtswithjustin.blogspot.com/2013/07/when-i-left-church-i-didnt-really-leave.html"&gt;When I Left The Church, I Didn't Really Leave The Church&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Millennials appear to be leaving the church in dramatic numbers, and people are very concerned about this. But to date, most of the responses have alternated between trying to make church more appealing and “hip”, and blaming millennials for their lack of character.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Rachel argues that the main reason millennials are leaving organized religion is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; because they are looking for something more hip, or because of their character flaws, but because they are looking for something spiritually significant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And they aren’t finding it in church.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This has been my experience. With rare exceptions, the churches I have attended over the years have failed to challenge me spiritually, mentally, or emotionally. I went in looking for depth, and instead found superficiality, a sense of entitlement, a feeling of being talked down to, and a lack of intellectual or spiritual insight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My attempts to improve things ran up against the institutional need to speak to the lowest common denominator. There was simply no room for the pursuit of a deeper spirituality, and there never would be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of my peers have had the same experience. And having been told that this church experience was &lt;em&gt;what Christianity was about&lt;/em&gt;, many of them have not only abandoned church, but Christianity along with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which brings us to Justin’s article. He makes the much-needed distinction between people leaving the institutional-organizational church that we in America know, and people leaving the &lt;em&gt;ecclesia&lt;/em&gt; that Jesus promised he would build.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two are not synonymous. One is an institution with board meetings, bank accounts, and legal officers, organized by a particular group of people with a particular set of interests and concerns — and the other is a spiritual entity that transcends location, culture, and citizenship. The two are not the same, and to equate them is nearly blasphemous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once we realize that the &lt;em&gt;church&lt;/em&gt; that we are normally addressing is an institution, it becomes obvious that this institution is subject to the same dynamics that affect any other institution. In the 90s, many people did realize this, and applied corresponding demographic and marketing knowledge to create mega-churches. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the advantages of running an institution are also its limitations. If you target your church activities towards 30-somethings with kids, you’re going to miss out on 20-somethings looking for meaning and authenticity. If you target your church activities towards 20-somethings looking for meaning and authenticity, you’re going to lose them when they’re 30-somethings with kids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And if you’re not consciously targeting anybody, chances are you’re targeting people just like you, and you will lose anyone who isn’t that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past, this wasn’t as obvious, because much more of society was living the same lifestyle, in the same way. Church could be oriented towards a particular middle-American culture, and only the outliers and eccentrics would find this troubling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But society is diversifying, and institutions have a hard time keeping up. In many cases, they just simply &lt;em&gt;cannot&lt;/em&gt; change enough to accommodate the people they are losing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is here that the distinction between Christianity and the institutional church becomes incredibly important. If the person leaving a particular institutional church believes that &lt;em&gt;this is Christianity&lt;/em&gt;, then they will believe that Christianity has failed to meet their needs, and that they have outgrown what Christianity has to offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The blurring of the lines between Christianity and a particular institution will have cost someone their faith.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if they understand that there is a distinction, that there is &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; a distinction, then their faith journey can continue unimpeded, and they can continue to value what they have left behind, knowing the benefit that many others still derive from it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For me, that distinction has been incredibly clear from a young age. I knew that the church I was attending was not the whole of Christianity; I knew that there were depths to Jesus and the scriptures that remained to be explored, that had not yet been fathomed by our civilization, let alone our congregation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But many of my peers have not been so lucky. They were implicitly told that the church as they knew it &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; Christianity. As they grew deeper spiritually and intellectually, and as they looked to become better people, to be in deeper relationships, and to do more with their lives, they found themselves outgrowing the church they knew. And believing that to be the entirety of Christianity, they left.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The answer to this problem is simple. It is to return our focus to the actual substance of our faith, to the exploration of the deep and inexhaustible mystery of God. And this means publicly rejecting our blasphemous identification of &lt;em&gt;what we have built&lt;/em&gt; with &lt;em&gt;what God is building&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2005/05/19/something-new/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2005/05/19/something-new/</link><pubDate>Thu May 19 15:59:00 CDT 2005</pubDate><title>Something new....</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>We've got something new in the works, and it should be cool...A new forum for everyone to interact on, post movie, music, and book reviews, get the latest inside scoop, critique our performances, etc,...</description><content:encoded>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;We've got something new in the works, and it should be cool...A new forum for everyone to interact on, post movie, music, and book reviews, get the latest inside scoop, critique our performances, etc, etc, etc...Where might this wonderful place be, you ask?

We're expanding our Local Talent Showcase to Capitol Roasters in Charleston. It'll be exciting - big venue, nice place, right in the heart of Charleston, etc, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the way the show works. All kinds of people sign up (like Daffy Duck, lately). We screen the people through auditions, listening to demo cds, or having heard them play...and pick a final list of about 8 people. Then we actually host the show, and perform at the end. It's a lot of fun, we get to hear a lot of good performers, and it keeps things interesting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So this Friday is the first one ever at Capitol Roasters. If it goes well, it will become a regular event. Right now, we're excited about it. Hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Capitol Roasters (160 Summers St, Charleston, WV)&lt;br /&gt;Friday, 6 May 2005&lt;br /&gt;8:00-10:00pm&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Micah&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2011/08/31/protocols-milk-crates/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2011/08/31/protocols-milk-crates/</link><pubDate>Wed Aug 31 09:59:56 CDT 2011</pubDate><title>Protocols: Milk Crates</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>I'm starting to publicly document the techniques I use for going about things, not because my ways are the best, or I am some kind of authority, but because improvement comes when previously unacknowl...</description><content:encoded>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I'm starting to publicly document the techniques I use for going about things, not because my ways are the best, or I am some kind of authority, but because improvement comes when previously unacknowledged things get shown and shared, and improved upon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reasons to use milk crates&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be clear, I use ones I picked up at Walmart and various other places, so I really don't know what "real" milk-crates are like. But here's why they're the best option for long-term storage:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;They won't hold small items or dust. Small things will fall through the holes, and so you're forced to either bag the small item with others like it, or to discard it. Because it won't hold dust, your stuff will not be as nasty when you go in to retrieve it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;They stack to infinity. There's really no limit to how many you can stack. With my second favorite storage technology (18 gallon tubs), more than two or three and the lids will start caving in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;They are fairly neat. With their cubular shape, a room full of milk-crates will just look like someone's attempt at archiving human history. Put that same room full of stuff into assorted containers, and they're going to be calling "Hoarders" on you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;They can be used as file drawers. They hold hanging file folders, and so are a perfect alternative to a "real" filing system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;They won't hold things that are too large. Because they have set dimensions, which can be used to hold everything from tennis balls to newspapers easily, they work for almost everything. Things that are too big for those dimensions need to be reconsidered. Or at least, dealt with differently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

But there are some likely culprits, some noticeable social and economic factors that appear to have prevented the development of modern technology. To me, two of these issues seem the most prominent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first is the ability to collect and spread in-depth information. Science is not so much the process of discovery as it is the process of accruing and combining various discoveries. The scientific method is important because it establishes a basis on which this sort of information can be collected and processed systematically and universally. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order for this to happen, there had to be sufficient philosophical groundwork, but there also had to be a way to share discoveries. In our history, science really took off after the invention of the printing press — once scientific research could be distributed and verified widely, science as we know it could begin. In contrast, the ancient world saw the discovery and subsequent loss of all sorts of valuable information and research. Discoveries did not “stick”. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So that’s the first issue. The second issue is that Rome did not see an economic interest in developing technology. They controlled the world — they had the manpower to do anything, and as many slaves as they could ever need. Rather than build a device to signal over long distances, it was better to just use messengers, which were in ample supply. Rather than build devices for farming, better to just enlist more slaves. In fact, to the extent that technology was developed into labor-saving devices, slaves would be out of work - leading to idle time, which in turn would lead to revolts. Better to avoid the technology, and just enlist more slaves. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of this disincentive, obvious areas of research were abandoned, useful tools were never built, long distance communications networks (signaling towers, etc) were not constructed. And so the industrial revolution was delayed for millennia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It may be that the core problem traces to the very strength of the empire. Empire can be looked at as a technology for controlling human resources. Before the agricultural revolution, a person could only produce approximately enough food to feed themselves. There was little in the way of food surplus, and so slavery made little economic sense. But after the agricultural revolution, a human being could produce enough to feed themselves and several more people, which meant that there was suddenly an economic incentive to building slave empires. And that is indeed what happened. Tribal leaders became warlords, became kings, became emperors. The scale of people enslaved and controlled grew dramatically, each iteration of world power expanding that control. And with Rome, this system reached its peak. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Rome was a dead-end. If slavery provided a deep incentive to avoid science and technology, then Rome would insure that science and technology never got started. They would have to insure this, in fact, if they were to survive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is only after the empire crumbled, and then the remnants of the empire crumbled after that, that science really began. Once there was a large society of free people all looking after their own economic interests (rather than being enslaved or enslaving others), then human interests and scientific and technological interests became aligned. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If this is so, then it is no wonder that technological advance has corresponded with the decline of empires, slavery, and social control. As technology has risen, so has human freedom. Where freedom was absent, technological progress slowed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It would seem that on a large enough scale, empire is poison to technology, and technology is poison to empire. &lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/tedx-we-all-live-in-the-developing-world/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/tedx-we-all-live-in-the-developing-world/</link><pubDate>Thu Aug 25 16:38:29 CDT 2016</pubDate><title>My TEDx talk: We All Live in the Developing World</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>Back in March, I had the privilege of speaking at a TEDx event in the Cayman Islands.

When we say “the develop*ed* world”, it suggests that our society is already finished—that we have already accomplished everything there is to achieve. And, in that context, when we say “the develop*ing* world”, it suggests that all the other societies just need to catch up—to repeat what others have accomplished before them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think this is wrong. None of us have figured everything out, and none of our societies have reached some kind of “end of history”, where everything will remain unchanging until the end of time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But most significantly, “less developed” nations &lt;em&gt;must not simply repeat what has already been done&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our world faces vast challenges, and vast opportunities. But the only way to overcome the challenges, and take hold of the opportunities, is to consciously and deliberately embrace our responsibility to create new things—to do things that have never been done before. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which is to say, we need to realize that there really is a future. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we do that, then we’ll recognize that we’re all just at the beginning. The shape of things to come has not yet been determined. Everything is—and must be—in flux. We have the opportunity to make the future better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it starts with recognizing that we all live in the developing world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/seEg2pESYOQ?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2008/09/15/there-no-hell-part-1/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2008/09/15/there-no-hell-part-1/</link><pubDate>Mon Sep 15 10:26:37 CDT 2008</pubDate><title>There Is No Hell (part 1)</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>There is no hell.

Instead, we have clear indications of what DOES exist, and it's not at all like hell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, by "hell", I mean the idea of eternal conscious torment for the wicked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bible teaches that the final state of the wicked is complete destruction. There may be punishment of the wicked before their final destruction, but destruction is always the end result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm going to show that the bible simply doesn't mention the prevailing doctrine of hell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But first, let me address a few things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hell is important, and no one believes in it&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's the thing: nobody actually believes in hell. Well, almost nobody. If Christians in general believed in hell, the possibility of eternal conscious torture for all their friends and family (and themselves) would haunt them constantly. They wouldn't sleep - they would devote every moment to evangelizing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I was growing up, I really DID believe in hell. And it haunted me. It tortured my thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who have not had this experience simply don't really believe the doctrine they are proclaiming. They're living in denial of their own beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people would argue that even if there isn't a hell, we shouldn't rock the boat. These people tend to think that the teaching of hell is useful, even if it's not necessarily true. Let me ask:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you believe that the truth about God is important?&lt;br/&gt;Do you believe that it's okay to obscure the Glory of God?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The truth is, the doctrine of hell is one of the primary sources of disillusionment with Christianity. Mark Twain and Bertrand Russell both mentioned it in rejecting Christianity. One person has said, "the doctrine of hell has created more atheists than anything else in the history of the world". Millions of people have recoiled in horror from believing in a God who would torture humans in ways we humans have never even imagined torturing each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The issue is not what God has the "right" to do. God has the right to send everyone to a torture chamber, and spend all eternity torturing us and laughing in glee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But God has revealed that he is not like that. His revelation of himself was designed to constrain him in certain ways. For example:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;God cannot lie. He has the right to lie, but he doesn't.&lt;br/&gt;God is good. He has the right to be evil, but he says that he isn't.&lt;br/&gt;God is love. He has the right to hate, but he has revealed that THAT is not him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I understood this when I was young. People would say things like, "we can't limit God with our ideas". But the problem is that God has chosen to limit himself. God has chosen to reveal himself to us, and his revelation is that he is LOVE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If God reveals that he is love, and defines in detail what love means, then we have to expect God to act consistently with that revelation. And if he doesn't act in that way, that calls into question the whole idea of God at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's exactly where millions of people stand. The God they have heard about is inconsistent and unloving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The doctrine of hell is important, because it tells us what kind of God we have. The doctrine of hell is important. And it's wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Idea of Justice&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unfortunately, when trying to disprove a pervasive concept, we have to spend our time arguing against interpretations of certain passages of scripture. This gives the impression that we are fighting an interpretive uphill battle. The truth is, the "proof-texts" for hell are so few and out-of-context that without 2,000 years of mixed-up teaching behind us, no one would come up with the idea of hell on their own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, to even the balance here, let's list a couple of cursory arguments against hell on the basis of justice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The basis of justice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The biblical idea of justice is "an eye for an eye". In that passage, God forbid anyone from inflicting punishment disproportionately greater than the crime. Some countries cut off the hands of thieves. The bible excluded this punishment. Similarly, the biblical idea of "an eye for an eye" excludes the idea of an eternity of infinite conscious torment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The penalty for sin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;The bible teaches us that The penalty for sin is DEATH, not eternal conscious torment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jesus paid the price&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;The penalty for sin is expressly stated to be "death". And Jesus is expressly stated to have paid the penalty for ALL the sin of ALL humans. So what does the penalty for all the sins of all the humans of all time look like? According to the bible, it looks like Jesus spending 3 days in the grave. Not in hell. Not in eternal conscious torment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the penalty for sin was eternal conscious torment, then Jesus DID NOT pay the penalty for our sins, and our savior didn't save us from anything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hell is futile&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;The bible reveals that God wants good for all people, even the wicked. God does not take pleasure in the downfall of the wicked. God wants all to repent. But there is no way that God can wish the good of wicked people, and simultaneously torture them forever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After 1000 years of ultimate torture, any principle of justice will have been fulfilled. Any further torture could only be for one's own perverse enjoyment. But God is not like that. He would love everyone in hell, and want good for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hell can serve absolutely no righteous purpose, because there is no end and no possibility for salvation, even when these people repent from their evil actions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The biblical ideas of justice, the nature of God, the penalty for sin, and Jesus' ability to save, all require us to reject the idea of hell. To believe in hell is to believe that God's revelation of justice and of himself is meaningless. And we're not even dealing with the biblical concept of mercy.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/11/21/1353556286/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/11/21/1353556286/</link><pubDate>Wed Nov 21 21:51:26 CST 2012</pubDate><title>1353556286</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>This is the deal with violence.

It can stop a person from doing something you don't like, but it can't change a person's mind. It can't win the hearts and minds of a people, or even of a pretty girl. It can't get us any of the things we really want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;And so violence is an approach to the world the gives up the good things we want out of life. And the only reason we would make that trade-off is because of fear, or maybe blindness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, it seems to be the case that if you engage in violence, you can't really ever partake of the higher pleasures and accomplishments the world offers. To deal with this, the rich out-source their violence to others, so they can experience the good life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/xianity/posts/200079810029211"&gt;https://www.facebook.com/xianity/posts/200079810029211&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2015/11/02/the-word-transhumanist/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2015/11/02/the-word-transhumanist/</link><pubDate>Mon Nov 02 20:17:31 CST 2015</pubDate><title>What’s up with the word Transhumanist?</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>Many of you know that I’ve spent the last couple of years trying to support and grow the [Christian Transhumanist Association](http://www.christiantranshumanism.org/), an organization devoted to creat...</description><content:encoded>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Many of you know that I’ve spent the last couple of years trying to support and grow the &lt;a href="http://www.christiantranshumanism.org/"&gt;Christian Transhumanist Association&lt;/a&gt;, an organization devoted to creating a better relationship between religion and technology. I’ve talked before about what &lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/christianity-and-transhumanism"&gt;Christian Transhumanism&lt;/a&gt; is, and what it means, and what our organization is about. But a question that I get from a lot of people is: &lt;em&gt;why the name?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Transhumanist” sounds weird, maybe even scary. So why use it? Why not call ourselves futurists, or technologists, or some other less bothersome word? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of factors at work here, and I won’t go into all of them (yet!), but one thing that draws me so strongly to this word is its poetry and its history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its very essence, the word invites us to engage with humanity, but also to reach beyond it. It suggests that humanism was right to focus on the glory and possibility of human life — but also that stopping there was stopping too soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Transhumanism” is currently a mostly secular movement. But in this fundamental orientation, I think it finds more in common with Christianity than traditional humanism ever did — certainly more than &lt;em&gt;secular&lt;/em&gt; humanism ever did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jesus opens his greatest commands with just such a call to the transcendent:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength…and love your neighbor as yourself&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In saying this, Jesus shows us what it means to be human. It is to connect outward to those around us, inward towards coherence, and upward towards God. As human beings, if we are unable to anchor ourselves in that which is beyond us, we lose something significant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout Christian history, this call toward transcendence has been fundamental. And so Christians have struggled over and over to express this idea in new ways—and sometimes—in new words.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps it was just this kind of confrontation with the limits of language that led Dante in 1320 to write:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Words may not tell of that &lt;strong&gt;transhuman&lt;/strong&gt; change:&lt;br/&gt;And therefore let the example serve, though weak,&lt;br/&gt;For those whom grace hath better proof in store (The Divine Comedy, Paradiso, Canto 1)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;…seemingly &lt;a href="http://www.theologyplus.org/the-history-of-the-word-transhumanism/"&gt;coining the word&lt;/a&gt; in the midst of one of history’s most significant works of religious literature. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This, of course, is not where things end. Other writers have worked with similar language to express these kinds of concepts. Theologian Paul Tillich expresses the core of Christian theology:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we have a profound doctrine of what I call a &lt;strong&gt;transcendent humanism&lt;/strong&gt;, a humanism which says that Christ is the fulfillment of essential man, of the Adamic nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;But perhaps most significantly, the language shows up in the work of Pierre Teilhard De Chardin. Chardin was a Jesuit priest, a paleontologist, and a mind-expanding theorist of the future. Some people credit him with foreseeing the internet, and discussing the possibility of accelerating technological progress leading up to a Singularity…in &lt;em&gt;1941&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1949, he explains what we mean by human freedom:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liberty: that is to say, the chance offered to every man (by removing obstacles and placing the appropriate means at his disposal) of ‘**trans-humanizing**’ himself by developing his potentialities to the fullest extent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;And later, in contemplating whether humanity would ultimately vanish beneath the waves of time, as many philosophers and scientists were arguing, he uses the term &lt;strong&gt;trans-humanity&lt;/strong&gt; to describe the spiritual vision that calls to us from beyond the boundaries of the world as we know it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And this is where we rejoin the mainstream discussion of transhumanism. Because Chardin was good friends with a biologist named Julian Huxley; and in 1957, Huxley is credited with introducing the term transhumanism in its modern secular form:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The human species can, if it wishes, transcend itself —not just sporadically, an individual here in one way, an individual there in another way, but in its entirety, as humanity. We need a name for this new belief. Perhaps &lt;strong&gt;transhumanism&lt;/strong&gt; will serve: man remaining man, but trans­cending himself, by realizing new possibilities of and for his human nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;That, as they say, is history. A concept from deep within Christian history had passed over, through the language of a secular biologist, into a new area of culture. Later, secular futurists would pick up the term and run with it, creating the movement known as “transhumanism” today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For us to use the word “transhumanist” is to reconnect with a set of aspirations and visions that began in the Christian tradition. And it is to simultaneously open the door to people looking for a way back to Christianity—which is what I want to talk about &lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/2015/11/16/mars-hill"&gt;next&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/08/27/1346113362/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/08/27/1346113362/</link><pubDate>Mon Aug 27 19:22:42 CDT 2012</pubDate><title>1346113362</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>When I come up with an idea, and think hard about it, and then discover that someone has already made it, I'm excited.

That was the most powerful thought in the whole film. Not just Africa, but the whole earth, is nothing but paradise. What is there on earth that is not beautiful and good? What is there that is not for our benefit? The land, the water, the oceans, the grass and trees, the clouds and the sky, the rain, the deserts, the ice and snow, the animals and plants and bugs and bacteria, are all beautiful and good. What of it is not for our enjoyment? What of it is not for our prosperity? The earth brings forth food and fuel and housing and clothing, and even beautiful luxuries like diamonds and gold, all for us! God's excess and lavish gifts are amazing and without bound.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why do we do the one thing that can ruin it? Why do we hate and kill each other?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It reminds me of the "Riverworld" sci-fi book series, in which billions of people wake up one day in a paradise, young, strong, beautiful, and immortal, with endless free food and clothing. They almost immediately set about torturing and enslaving each other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why does humanity do this?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More thoughts tomorrow...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-micah&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2005/05/07/capitol-roasters-show-analyzed/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2005/05/07/capitol-roasters-show-analyzed/</link><pubDate>Sat May 07 13:44:00 CDT 2005</pubDate><title>Capitol Roasters Show Analyzed</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>The Capitol Roasters show was great...but we ran 46 minutes over schedule!

Beside the lake was anything but overdone. The grass ran right up the water's edge, and a habit-made walking trail ran alongside it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Insects fluttered in the grass, buzzing around, keeping things active. A misshapen dragonfly followed a circuit above the water, but it was the less pleasant bugs that had my attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If only the world was free of these, nature would be perfect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suddenly I saw something else. I imagined God walking along the water, and I saw him enjoying each of these insects as something unique, each fulfilling its purpose, each keeping the world alive and busy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've seen old paintings where man walks among the beasts, lions and snakes all in harmony under man's leadership. It's the ancient image of paradise - a kingdom of nature, with humans as the rulers. Man is the representative of god, the stories tell us, and humanity exercises his care for the creatures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These insects weren't intruders - they were &lt;em&gt;mine&lt;/em&gt;. Not &lt;em&gt;mine&lt;/em&gt; meaning ownership - but that they were there for me, for me to care for and watch over. And I was walking along the water as a man amongst them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's something amazing about realizing the world is &lt;em&gt;yours&lt;/em&gt; - regardless of who owns it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And there's something amazing about realizing that all the ugly, unpleasant things are part of the complexity and depth and beauty that make up the world.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2004/12/21/weekend-in-hillsboro/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2004/12/21/weekend-in-hillsboro/</link><pubDate>Tue Dec 21 08:38:00 CST 2004</pubDate><title>Weekend in Hillsboro</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>We played in Hillsboro, Oh on Friday, and it was great.

Definitely looks like a Christmas movie.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Playing in the Colony Theater was cool. It was an old classic-style thing, and our name was up in lights. Woohoo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They put us on a bit too early, before most of the people were there, but it was still cool, and a lot of fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you not familiar with Ohio, they have these funky stores called "United Dairy Farmers". They're basically just weirdly-named 7-Elevens, with more Ice Cream. We found these things there called "Micro-Shakes". They're milkshakes that come frozen, and you microwave them to make them ready-to-eat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those definitely deserve a mention.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2007/08/07/christianity-is-chinese/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2007/08/07/christianity-is-chinese/</link><pubDate>Tue Aug 07 23:32:00 CDT 2007</pubDate><title>Christianity is Chinese</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>China will be the most Christian nation on earth.In this article, the author suggests that Christianity is on the verge of becoming China-centric.

Christianity is growing faster in China than in anywhere else, and soon China will be sending out more missionaries than any other country in the world. With over 10,000 new converts EVERY DAY, and more than 100 MILLION current adherents, China is becoming more Christian than the USA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And note this: China still officially discourages or oppresses Christianity. How many Christians would the USA have, if Christianity was actively oppressed?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm guessing that Chinese Christianity is not only growing faster, but is also much stronger, deeper, and more sincere than in any other place on earth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oppression breeds authenticity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the reasons I believe that this is happening is because Chinese Christianity largely exists without ecclesiastical structure and the trappings of church. China and Japan have an active "non-church" version of Christianity, which flourishes without any religious organization whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Christianity in America, by contrast, has largely sold its soul to the government.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-micah&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2011/11/28/what-real/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2011/11/28/what-real/</link><pubDate>Mon Nov 28 09:42:00 CST 2011</pubDate><title>what is real</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>I think the New Testament is obsessed with the question of what is real.

The Jewish prophets spent a lot of time and energy telling people that idols weren't real, that they were made of wood and stone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which, when you think about it, is kind of odd. According to normal critiques of religion, the impulse to worship a god comes from the need for some kind of comfort against the harsh realities of life. If this were the case, why would the Jewish people highlight this effect so strongly? Wouldn't they want to obscure this phenomenon?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regardless, when you get to Jesus and the early Christians, this analysis is turned upon the system of organized religion. Jesus begins it when he talks to the Samaritan woman, and answers her question about which place of worship is best by pointing out that God is spirit, and so those who worship God have to be concerned about what is true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, the temple isn't really real. It's just a box.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jesus takes it farther. He points out that what a person eats doesn't tell you anything about who they really are - it's what they say that reveals the truth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With one critique, Jesus just eradicated the temple, the dietary, and the purity laws.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paul and the rest of the early Christians continue the critique, pointing out that God doesn't live in a box, that circumcision doesn't mean anything, that ceremonial washings, and animal sacrifices, and special foods, and special days, and special times - are all irrelevant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the author of Hebrews puts it, they are all shadows, at their best, pointing to something else. And what they point to is the real truth, the facts of human action and psychology and relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was the obsession of the early Christians. Paul spends most of his time applying theological ideas to the intricacies of how the rich and the poor could eat together as equals. James says real religion is to care for people, and to practice real relationships. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sharing food is real. Conversation is real. Relationships are real. What you do every day is real. The bed you sleep on at night, and your shoes, and your coat, and your interaction with the checkout person at the grocery store - these things are the substance of your life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everything in organized religion was just an attempt to get close to those things. And everything in organized religion today is a parody of those things: Artificial community, artificial meals, artificial conversation and artificial learning. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They're just shadows, and the reality is right in front of you.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2011/10/03/paul/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2011/10/03/paul/</link><pubDate>Mon Oct 03 07:37:10 CDT 2011</pubDate><title>Paul</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>A lot of people who really like Jesus, really don't like Paul.

One book puts it like this: everything good in Christianity came from Jesus, everything bad came from Paul. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This sort of makes sense. After all, Paul never met Jesus. Paul doesn't sound like Jesus. Paul doesn't seem that concerned with the details of Jesus' life. Paul says a lot of things that you'll never find in the gospels. It would be easy to say that Paul was a hijacker, who turned Christianity into something it was never supposed to be. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But sometimes when you've been with people a long time, it's hard for them to see you as you are, or to understand what you're really telling them. They have a hard time realizing you've changed. And it's not until someone else comes along, someone new who truly gets you, that you are free to be your full self, the self you've claustrophobically been trying to express. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paul is that person for Jesus. The apostles knew Jesus was radical, they knew he had changed a lot of things. They even knew he had risen from the dead. But they couldn't see what Paul could see. Peter still struggled with talking to Gentiles, circumcision was still being debated. But Paul sees the genius at the heart of Jesus' teachings, sees the paradoxical brilliance of victory through defeat, and spends the rest of his life trying to make that comprehensible to the outside world. He's not interested in biography, or in repeating and expanding on the parables. He's not interested in trying to maintain ties with the more traditional followers of Jesus. He wants only to spread the incisive ideas at the heart of Jesus' message, to as many people as possible, in as clear a way as he can manage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paul, above all the other apostles, actually &lt;em&gt;got&lt;/em&gt; Jesus. But then, the fact that the best apostle of all didn't show up until almost too late...shouldn't be surprising for the disciples of a man who said the last will be first. &lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2005/05/02/new-shoes/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2005/05/02/new-shoes/</link><pubDate>Mon May 02 19:08:00 CDT 2005</pubDate><title>New Shoes</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>I had to do something productive this weekend, so I went out a bought something I'd been wanting for a while...Velcro Shoes.I haven't had a pair since I was six, and once I started thinking about them...</description><content:encoded>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I had to do something productive this weekend, so I went out a bought something I'd been wanting for a while...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Velcro Shoes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven't had a pair since I was six, and once I started thinking about them, I just couldn't stop.

From the backwoods of West Virginia, the dust of Oklahoma, and the pouring rain of Seattle, they've created their own brand of scruffy, intelligent rock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It all began while cruising around small-town Oklahoma in an old LeBaron convertible, the mid-nineties mix of country music and alternative rock scratching through their FM radio. There the guys beat together their idea of what real music was, and what a band should be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But their lives were about to take several twists and turns. Through the earliest years of the 21st century, they would move from Oklahoma to Seattle, from Seattle to living on the road, and from living on the road back to their original home of West Virginia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was while in WV, in a town with few venues and a sparse music scene, that they would first buckle down and do the one thing most bands fail to do - grow a huge, loyal audience. Where there had been no venues, they took a local movie theater, and made it one of the most popular ones around. Where there had been a sparse music scene, they helped grow a network of musicians and bands that captivated the area. And then, they started aiming for the biggest goal they could find: to fill Charleston, WV's Civic Center.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Riding a wave of anticipation, and looking for a way to grow geographically and musically, they made one final move, and headed for Nashville, TN.&lt;br /&gt;From Nashville, the brothers have struck out into the college circuit, traveling as far as Tulsa, Oklahoma, and Clarion, Pennsylvania. They've been selected to play alongside performers like Sister Hazel, Gin Blossoms, and Joan Jett &amp;amp; The Blackhearts. And they've started doing what they do best - growing a huge, loyal audience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Quick Facts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Birthdays: Micah (November 11, 1981 in Charleston, WV); Josiah (August 19th, 1983 in Charleston, WV); Gabriel (February 11th, 1987 in Seattle, WA).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;All vegetarians.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;All libertarians.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;All preterists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;All DIY maniacs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Founded their own record label in 2005, Brick &amp;amp; Stone Records.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Have performed over 300 tour dates as of this writing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Are known for crazy stage lighting, on-stage stunts, climbing towers, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wrote, recorded and released 52 songs consecutively over a 52 week period spanning April 2007-2008.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Have been touring non-stop since 2003.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Are known for their guerrilla gigs, self-promoted concerts in strange places.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Have toured nationally and internationally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2013/06/07/iron-man-and-modern-identity-crisis/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2013/06/07/iron-man-and-modern-identity-crisis/</link><pubDate>Fri Jun 07 00:11:16 CDT 2013</pubDate><title>Iron Man and the Modern Identity Crisis</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>A year ago, I was traveling across the world.

I had just moved out of my house, taken a leave of absence from my part-time job, and left without a lot of money or a good sense of whether I would be employed when I got back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I slept on hard floors, in hostels, on couches, and in rooms that were built on rooftops. I went without warm showers for a long time. I hiked up into the mountains of Nepal, witnessed the aftermath of the Egyptian revolution firsthand, and tried to figure out what to do when a street fight broke out around me in Moscow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And when I came back, I was changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had a new mission, and a different sort of intensity. I knew what I wanted to do, and I knew that to do it, I needed all the skills I could muster. I would have to learn, and learn quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doors began to open. Ambiguity began to drain from me. Things that had been constants in my life for decades began to shift.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lot of things were culminating. I had stopped being vegetarian after ten years. Now, at the age of 30, I took my first real full-time job. Not to settle down — but to throw myself as hard as I could into what I was pursuing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, I began to notice a lot of other people doing similar things. A blogger I used to read abandoned his writing in order to pursue ‘technical skills’. A guy who &lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/5/1/4279674/im-still-here-back-online-after-a-year-without-the-internet"&gt;left the internet&lt;/a&gt; for a year, returned with fury, and a new take on what it is we’re all &lt;em&gt;doing&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But I didn’t fully realize what was going on until I saw Iron Man 3. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ridiculous as it sounds, I think Iron Man captures something that many of us have been struggling with for a long time. I think it’s particularly strong if you’re male, but it’s really about humans, not gender.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s the question of who we are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is, of course, the stuff of clichéd mid-life crisis after mid-life crisis. It’s men starting to go bald, and trying to solve that problem with questionable taste in sports cars. It’s the lifeblood of the late-night infomercial industry. It’s something we’ve parodied and talked about and generally dismissed for decades and decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in our time, that question has become much more pointed. The identity crisis of the modern world has reached down and out until it touches almost everybody, leaving us with the mid-life crisis, the quarter-life crisis, and a crisis for almost any fractional value you care to name. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For society as a whole, this seems to be driven by economic and technological change. The career structures of our world have been radically upset, leaving many people questioning whether traditional career advancement even makes sense. Technology has changed our social structures, and even our sense of what humans can do. The Terminator movies of the 80s, embodying our fear of what the machines might do to us, gave way to the Matrix films of the 90s, embodying our fear that technology had already swallowed us whole. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many people, this seems like exactly what has happened. Social networks came and went, until Facebook’s magic formula finally engulfed everyone’s lives. The constant stream of updates and information grew until many people feel like they are chained to their devices, always on call to react or respond to what’s coming next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And so, disillusioned with traditional society, caught up in a reactive codependence on our machines, many of us exist as consumers but not creators, reactors but never drivers of change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the crisis many of us face. But it is not the crisis faced by Tony Stark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the surface, it would seem that Tony’s problems come from exactly the opposite direction. He was at the peak of achievement, influence, and power, and just when you thought he could go no further, he turned himself into a superhero. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it was these world-scale responsibilities that began to make him crack. Initially, he handled them quite capably. But the better he did, the more intense the pressure became. The more problems he solved, the larger the problems he faced; until, in &lt;em&gt;The Avengers&lt;/em&gt;, he found himself up against extra-terrestrial forces so far out of scale, it left him shaken and reeling. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He had taken on the responsibilities of protecting the world, only to find his view of the world ripped apart. Left without a world he could feel at ease in, he retreated to the only one he still controlled: his robotic exoskeleton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is where &lt;em&gt;Iron Man 3&lt;/em&gt; begins. Tony is suffering from panic attacks, inability to sleep, and something resembling PTSD. He hides from his problems by obsessively building robotic suits in his basement, continually tinkering, withdrawing from life, putting up an iron curtain between himself and everything else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn’t actually that far from the crisis many of us face. After all, it’s not just that we’ve become disillusioned with conventional careers and achievement, and it’s not just that we feel swallowed by our own technological world. It’s that we, like Tony Stark, have been given grandiose dreams, and the narratives to fill them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of us have even pursued those dreams, momentarily brushing the ceiling, catching a glimpse of what life was like on the other side. And usually in terror, we recoiled. We flew too close to the sun, and we got burned. We’re left on the ground, shaking from the glimpse of the massive responsibilities that &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; lie on the other side of any significant achievement — unable to move forward, unable to go back. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having once been given dreams, we cannot abandon them. But having seen the other side, we cannot proceed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the dilemma Tony faces. He cannot abandon his self-imagined role as protector of the world. But he has seen enough to know that this role is too heavy for him to bear. And so he’s stuck, unable to function, caught in the middle of the perfect anxiety-inducing storm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lens through which Iron Man 3 tackles this problem is with the question: &lt;em&gt;Who is Iron Man?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The answer is far from clear. Is it the suit? Or the man who wears the suit? Or is it the all-powerful role he has to play? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is only when exiled from his home, his life, and his technological weapons, out in the middle of rural Tennessee in the dead of Winter, that he finally encounters the answer. And the answer comes from a young boy’s confusion as to who &lt;em&gt;Tony Stark&lt;/em&gt; is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You’re the mechanic, right?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the turning point, the question that unravels everything. Tony’s all-powerful role goes away, along with his chronic anxiety. He is no longer the man who must save the world — he is simply the man who knows how to build things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in building things, there is salvation. Because this, really, is what defines him. This is what he is made for — to create, to build, to construct. He is not a role, a suit, or a technology. He is the mechanic, and he makes things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And this is where Iron Man stands out from thousands of other stories. It doesn’t just answer our identity crisis by stripping things away. It doesn’t think we’ll find ourselves when we leave our jobs, or quit the internet for a year, or venture off into the wilderness, or follow a medicine man to India. It doesn’t look for the answer to our questions in recovering some pristine, primitive form of humanity, untainted by the modern world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, it turns around and gives us something back. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike so many stories which glorify the act of abandonment, which hold up the ideal of individuals leaving the world behind, heading off into the wilderness, giving up technology, quitting their jobs and walking away, Iron Man gives us a glimpse of what happens &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; you leave:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You begin to build.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Armed with his new realization, Tony is able to let his suits go. He is not defined by them, and he does not need to hide behind them. But he isn’t rejecting technology. He’s not defined by what he has built, but he &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; defined by the process of building itself. Strip away everything he has, and put him in the wilderness, and he will begin to build civilization from the ground up. He, after all, is a human being, and technology emerges as naturally from us as beehives do from bees. He is not defined by his technology, but he cannot be defined apart from the act of creation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And so his tools, which had begun to swallow him whole, are now freed to function as tools. He is able to solve the last remaining issues with his heart, he is able to use technology more directly and more powerfully than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it is here, in this new self-understanding, that he truly becomes Iron Man. Not as the suit, not as the role, but as the white-hot power of creation that keeps working when everything else is gone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is what I have started to see around me. People increasingly moving to shed their roles and their self-perceptions. People moving away from simple consumption, picking up tools and skills, and beginning to build. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The man who abandoned the internet for a year went looking for meaning. And he came back with the conclusion that meaning was not found “off the internet”, but in the act of making something. His mentor told him, in so many words, “Stop thinking of your life as a narrative, and just build”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m hearing more stories like this all the time. A few weeks ago, strolling around Portland, my web developer friend said to me: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I just enjoy being the car mechanic of the internet. I make things work. And I like that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And I knew exactly what he meant. &lt;/p&gt;

Being set apart isn't about community, it's about identity. Being set apart forms identity, which forms community. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NT can be seen as addressing the problems that arise when these things get out of order. The "legalists" in the NT were people who put the set-apartness first, forming community around those markers (circumcision, law-keeping) in contradiction to Jesus and Paul, who formed community around the identity that the set-apartness was supposed to form. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is why Paul can say circumcision had value, but if you were to encounter an uncircumcised person who nevertheless was “spiritually circumcised”, you should recognize him as a spiritual sibling. The idea being that being set apart is one way people come to a certain identity, but not the only way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Incidentally, I interpret this "identity" as being the Genesis 1 vision for humanity, a vision where being the child of God entails engaging in the process of creation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Certainly, all of this can be interpreted differently. I'm just offering my initial response. Community is a hard subject!&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/all-are-alive/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/all-are-alive/</link><pubDate>Thu Jul 14 08:51:45 CDT 2016</pubDate><title>All Are Alive</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>I have often thought about the way we define ‘death’.

When is someone actually dead? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At one point in time, we defined death as the point when someone’s heart stopped beating. Now, we define death as the cessation of brain activity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But even “cessation of brain activity” just means that the brain activity has dropped below a certain level. We are starting to see that even after “brain death”, there is still possibility for recovery of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In reality, the question is how far does someone have to go before we can no longer bring them back? As our technology gets better, we push that boundary further and further. We have to redefine death again and again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How far can we push that boundary? How far back will the definition of death have to go?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Luke 20:37-39, Jesus makes an interesting statement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But in the account of the burning bush, even Moses showed that the dead rise, for he calls the Lord ‘the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.’ He is not the God of the dead, but of the living, for to him all are alive.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jesus makes the incredible claim that, to God, all are alive. But he doesn’t seem to be suggesting that Moses and everyone else are simply living on as disembodied souls, and are alive to God in that way. Rather, he seems to be using “all are alive” as a way of talking about &lt;em&gt;resurrection&lt;/em&gt;. And yet, resurrection is something that is future—so how do these two things connect?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s another story in Luke, where Jesus is summoned to the house of a man whose daughter is sick. On the way, they receive word that the daughter has died. But Jesus continues on, and when he arrives he tells the mourners, “Stop wailing…She is not dead but asleep.” (Luke 8:52). He then proceeds to bring her back to life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the context, it is clear that the girl &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; dead. She is legally and medically and ethically deceased. And yet, Jesus sees that she has not passed beyond &lt;em&gt;his&lt;/em&gt; ability to heal her. Thus, to him, she is “only sleeping”. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Jesus, it would seem that the definition of death is quite relative. It’s not about any objective thing that has happened in the body—it’s about the ability to heal. If we can heal the person, then they are not really dead, they are just comatose, or “only sleeping”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How far can the definition of death be pushed?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jesus pushed it much farther than was standard in the ancient world. We’ve pushed it much farther than was standard two centuries ago. And each time we lean over the edge of death, and bring someone back, more people are no longer dead, but “only sleeping”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How far can that process go? What limits do we see, looking towards the ultimate future?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s possible there is no limit. After all, as Jesus says, when we take a God’s-eye view—&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;All are alive&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/04/09/god-can-be-trusted/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/04/09/god-can-be-trusted/</link><pubDate>Mon Apr 09 09:38:21 CDT 2012</pubDate><title>God can be trusted</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>Once I heard someone declare that God was like an umbrella, always standing between you and all the trouble raining down.

I mean, it's pretty clear to me that God isn't keeping people from breaking their legs or falling off buildings. How would it make me feel safe to know that God was protecting me, if he was still going to let me fall off a building?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My answer back then was that God isn't really protecting us. He's not keeping us from harm, or making sure we do well on our homework. It would seem that he's not in that kind of business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But I think I was wrong. I think we can trust in God, and can feel the safety of that protection. It's just that we missed what he was really protecting us from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like becoming &lt;em&gt;stagnant&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;Like ceasing to change or grow.&lt;br/&gt;Like having no options or choices. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can trust in God to always provoke us to new things, to new realizations, to new experiences. We can trust in God to refuse to let us stay set in our ways. We can trust in God to always shake things up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, this is what most of the biblical story is about. God does all these things, like kick Adam and Eve out of the garden, or stop construction on the Tower of Babel, and all of it is in the service of keeping humanity from getting stuck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this is also what we can see just by looking around the natural world. It's clear that God is not keeping people from falling off buildings. But it's also clear that God &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; keeping people from getting lazy. He keeps pushing us onward, upsetting our economy, our lifestyles, our ability to think in terms of 40-year careers. It would seem that he wants us to be &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt;, but if we're not up for that, he'll take &lt;em&gt;different&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I have a newfound trust in God. I know he's looking out for me. I just realize that what he's looking out for is a lot different than what I was told to think.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2013/08/06/law-christ/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2013/08/06/law-christ/</link><pubDate>Tue Aug 06 00:16:18 CDT 2013</pubDate><title>The Law of Christ</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>*This was written circa 1999, and circulated on some mailing lists and publishing sites at the time.*

When Jesus came, the law was no longer needed. It was fulfilled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many Christians today believe that Christianity is a set of rules and regulations that replaced the rules and regulations of the old law. They come up with lists of commands that Christians today have to follow; and when they can't find a place commanding something, they quickly find it "inferred" in another place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach is wrong. Christianity is not another list of rules, it is a new approach to living. Christianity only requires you to adopt a goal: loving others. The old law and "regulations" found in the New Testament are helpful guides to achieving this, but they are no substitute for the real thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is apparent when we look at the life of Jesus, who broke many rules. When confronted about it, he only replied that the laws were made for man, and not the other way around. When Jesus was in a situation where he had to choose between doing the "right" thing and helping people, he chose people every time. This is an amazing attitude coming from a religious leader, most of whom promote their own arbitrary dogmas as the absolute last word. Instead, Jesus stated that there were really only two laws: love God, and love man.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Judaism (and all other religions until this point) had been focused on external rituals and complicated legal codes. Jesus cut through all of this to show what God truly wanted, demonstrating that all of the trappings of religion had just been trying to point man in that direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although this is a hard concept to grasp for many people, it is a concept born out in many scriptures. It is only through millennia of false teaching that we have forgotten this. Jesus showed us that love was in fact the sum of all of God's commands. That is the only thing God ever really required.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(I suggest you read the following passages: Gal 6:2; Matt 22:36-40; Mark 12:28-32; Luke 10:26-27; John 13:34-35; Rom 13:8-10; Gal 5:14)&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2013/06/01/state-christianity-and-world/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2013/06/01/state-christianity-and-world/</link><pubDate>Sat Jun 01 10:07:59 CDT 2013</pubDate><title>The State of Christianity and the World</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>There is a lot of negativity these days about the state of the world.

There’s always been a lot of negativity, so I guess that’s not surprising. What is surprising is how this negativity persists despite the fact that the world is doing amazingly, incredibly well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Worldwide, violence is at an all-time low.[^1]&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Worldwide, standard of living is at an all-time high.[^2]&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Over the last 50-100 years, we’ve seen dramatic increases in the standard of living of the poorest countries…meaning that we are now on a strong trajectory towards a more equal world.[^3]&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Freedom and individual liberty have never been more pronounced.[^4]&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Life expectancy continues to rise.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Dictators seem to be falling at an increasing rate.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2 billion people use the internet.[^5]&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;5 billion people use a cellphone.[^6]&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Communications technologies have put formerly isolated individuals in touch with broader human society, and exposed them to educational resources never before available.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be sure, there are terrible things still going on. In prior generations, we would have remained ignorant about these things; now, we know about them, are horrified, and can do something about them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And, in fact, do. To an incredible degree, people are now involved in trying to help out and improve the rest of the world — witness the international response to events like the tragedy in Haiti, for example. Or observe how many people are involved in trying to help alleviate things like hunger and thirst on other continents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people are worried about the decline of religion. This is something of a misunderstanding. Christianity, at least, continues to increase worldwide. The percentage of humanity that considers themselves Christian is about the same as it was in 1910, despite enormous population growth. And Christianity is spreading rapidly in non-Western parts of the world.[^7]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is primarily in America and Europe that we see a decline. But even there, church attendance is higher in America now than it was in America’s early days.[^8] And Europe and America continue to have large Christian populations, and even larger groups of people profoundly influenced by Christian values.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So why do we see a religious decline among some first-world nations?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It seems to me that we can identify several reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Christianity is no longer seen as leading people morally. In surveying the history of slavery, racism, and sexual abuse, many people feel that Christians generally defended the “less moral side”, taking stands FOR slavery, FOR racism, and IN DEFENSE OF sexual abusers.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Christianity has a long history of getting involved in distasteful politics. And once a religion has gotten its hands dirty in this way, people rarely give it a second chance. This is widely regarded as the reason for the decline of Christianity in Europe — people simply remember too well the terrible things Christianity has been involved with in their history. (The Crusades and the Inquisition are just two of the more well-known examples).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The same is increasingly true for America — as conservative Christians over the last several decades allied themselves with a political party, they suffered the fallout of having identified and vouched for corrupt and dishonest politicians. Large segments of American young people think of Christianity as primarily a power-hungry political movement.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Many people want to live meaningful, compassionate, and moral lives. Given the above facts, they feel that Christianity is a hindrance to this goal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The thing to note here is that these are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; failings on the part of society. They are failings on the part of Christianity, both to stand for what it should stand for, and to explain that value to others. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What are we to take from this? If there is anything that comes across in the biblical story, it is that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;God will get his message out, no matter what.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This is often &lt;em&gt;in spite of&lt;/em&gt; his people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;God has been pushing his vision forward for thousands of years, and continues to push it forward today. But often, Christians have lost that message.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of standing up for the incredible story that human beings are &lt;em&gt;the image of God&lt;/em&gt;, Christians have often stood up for a vision limited by the culture around them. Instead of standing up for the profound moral vision of the bible, Christians have often stood up for whatever was socially acceptable. Instead of desiring to be a &lt;em&gt;peculiar people&lt;/em&gt;, with an unbounded and shockingly optimistic vision of the future, Christians have often given in to the cynicism of a culture that says nothing ever changes, and “all things continue as they have since the beginning of creation”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Christians have often been far too afraid to acknowledge what God was doing. And as a result, many people have run from Christianity, in an attempt to find God. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jesus pointed out a similar dynamic in his day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Christianity and the world are stronger than they’ve ever been. But neither will fully live up to their potential until Christians decide to lay claim to and take part in what God is already doing. &lt;/p&gt;

Unfortunately, it’s less common for people to ask why these Christians were scientific pioneers, and how they understood the relationship between these two domains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Francis Bacon, &lt;em&gt;science was no less than humanity’s religious mission&lt;/em&gt;. He believed you could read this right out of Genesis 1, where God laid out his own creative process, and then invited humanity to imitate it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Bacon saw it, God had ordained for &lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/partnership-with-god"&gt;humanity to rule over the world&lt;/a&gt;, and although humanity had corrupted its reign through wickedness, humanity’s reign could be restored through the ambitious, but disciplined, application of humility and love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s important to understand how he saw this fitting together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Humanity’s power, Bacon said, was knowledge. To know the world was to have power over it. So in order to exercise all the power that God had intended for us to have, we first had to understand everything we could about the world that God had made. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But humanity did &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; know much about the world God had made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;History had been the slow churning of human ideas and inventions, with accidental discoveries, small leaps forward, and plenty of time spent sliding back into darkness. After eons of learned discussion, most of the best ideas were the same ones people had been discussing thousands of years before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem was that humanity was addicted to its own fantasies, and hadn’t bothered to systematically interrogate nature to see what it actually revealed. Instead of looking to see whether our ideas held up, we deferred to the ideas of people who seemed authoritative or impressive by our own superficial standards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We had God’s truth written all around us, and had been too distracted by vanity to actually read it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/beginners-paradox"&gt;To change this would mean humbling ourselves&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, both individually and collectively. It would require laying down our most cherished ideas, in order to be open to God’s own revelation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This meant intently observing nature, and then systematically devising experiments to unlock the true causes of things. It meant rigorously holding up our most cherished ideas to the bright light of critique—from both the natural world, and each other. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We could no longer assume that we, or the ancients, had gotten it right; we would have to have the humility to open our ideas to criticism from any direction, and any source. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only then could we be certain that we were moving towards the truth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This core idea—of systematically seeking to understand nature, and then subjecting our ideas to open, public, egalitarian critique—is the beating heart of what makes science what it is today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Bacon also believed that &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Atlantis-Great-Instauration-Crofts-Classics-ebook/dp/B01DQ3GZ9M/ref=as_li_ss_tl?_encoding=UTF8&amp;me=&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=micahredding-20&amp;linkId=9c4eabdd95943a4e24392248468ea779"&gt;the scientific project had to be driven by love&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After all, the lust for power had been a source of deep corruption, and Bacon didn’t believe that any pursuit founded on that would last. According to Bacon, the pursuit of power alone, or even knowledge alone, led to natural limits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So if humanity was to achieve unlimited power, it would have to have an unlimited goal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bacon thought that the only sure motivation—the only motivation that had &lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/2015/08/07/infinite-morality-jesus"&gt;infinite scale, and unlimited reach&lt;/a&gt;—was the ambition to do good on behalf of all life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus, science could not be merely an academic or knowledge-oriented enterprise. It had to pursue knowledge for the sake of application, leading to the creation of new technologies, for the sake of cultivating a better world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if it did this, if humanity could adopt this altruistic motivation, and this stance of humility—then nature would reveal itself to us, and all the power of the universe would be ours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his fictional work, &lt;a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Atlantis-Great-Instauration-Crofts-Classics-ebook/dp/B01DQ3GZ9M/ref=as_li_ss_tl?_encoding=UTF8&amp;me=&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=micahredding-20&amp;linkId=29c67ae085652cb4df01cfec4e1993fc"&gt;The New Atlantis&lt;/a&gt;, Bacon laid out his vision of what that might look like. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story is about the discovery of an island nation that had been forgotten by the rest of the world. By various means, the nation had acquired knowledge of the scriptures, and upon contemplating the religious calling of Genesis 1, had set out to construct a scientific enterprise founded on that mission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They had constructed observatories, workshops, and manufacturing facilities on high towers, and in deep caves of the earth. They had built instruments of all kinds, and collected detailed measurements of the heavens, the earth, the waves and the wind. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And they had developed all kinds of abilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They could create artificial metals, and new tastes and smells. They had new kinds of music, and sounds unknown to other humans. They could project light to form vast scenes and experiences that were indistinguishable from reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They could produce food that was bigger, sweeter, tastier; food that had medicinal qualities, or could change people in various ways; food that could make people stronger, or able to go without eating for long periods of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They could genetically engineer new species, mix characteristics of different species together into new forms, and provoke the evolution of primitive creatures into more complex ones. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They were able to heal all kinds of diseases, and had techniques for &lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/2016/02/17/why-christians-should-support-radical-life-extension"&gt;life extension and radical longevity&lt;/a&gt;. They had flying machines and submarines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They could even control the wind and weather.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Francis Bacon was cut off before he could finish telling us where this might go. But this was his vision of science—a vision centered on deep humility, rooted in the audacious belief that &lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/the-resurrection-is-technological"&gt;humanity was given power over all things&lt;/a&gt;, and driven by the Christian mission to create on behalf of all life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was also a supremely technological vision, which explicitly rejected the idea of knowledge without application. The purpose of science, as Francis Bacon saw it, was to create new technologies to transform the world, as God had always intended humanity to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In every respect, this was a vision of Christian Transhumanism. Bacon didn’t use the term “transhuman”—this was left for &lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/2015/11/02/the-word-transhumanist"&gt;Dante, Teilhard, and others&lt;/a&gt;—but his vision of humanity as a fundamentally transformational species, rooted in possibilities beyond the world we know, was transhuman to its core.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And in the early 1600s, this was the vision that drove him to articulate the scientific method, and entreat King James (yes, of the Bible) to establish a scientific enterprise at the center of society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s unfortunate is that Christians have been quick to cite Bacon as an example of someone pairing faith with science—without ever stopping to consider &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; he paired them, or just how deeply that pairing might go. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bacon believed that in his contemplation of scripture, he had discovered something monumental, and that if he could express this to the world, it would be the dawning of a new era in human history. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the impact he had, it’s intriguing to wonder what would happen if Christians were to take his vision more seriously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.christiantranshumanism.org/"&gt;Learn more about Christian Transhumanism&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/5-theses-for-the-next-reformation/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/5-theses-for-the-next-reformation/</link><pubDate>Tue Oct 31 20:07:17 CDT 2017</pubDate><title>5 Theses for the Next Reformation</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>500 years ago TODAY, Martin Luther nailed 95 theses to the door of a German church, kick-starting the Protestant Reformation, and changing the course of history.

I believe we’re in the middle of &lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/christian-transhumanism-is-the-next-reformation"&gt;the Next Reformation&lt;/a&gt;—a reformation that will be defined, not by another Martin Luther, but by all of us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I believe that what will emerge from this Next Reformation is a profoundly forward-looking faith, that will proactively engage the future, and draw us toward new levels of flourishing as a society and as a world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toward that end, I offer 5 theses for the Next Reformation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Christians must abandon the war against science and technology, and embrace them both as profound expressions of the image of God.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Christians must abandon escapist notions of the future, and embrace the biblical vision of God working to renew the cosmos.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Christians must abandon the ethics of blindly following rules, and embrace Christ’s ethic of sharing in the purposes of God.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Christians must abandon theologies which disempower humanity, and embrace the biblical vision of participation in Christ.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Christians must abandon religion that exists only for itself, and recover the call of Abraham to bless all creation.&lt;/li&gt;

When Jesus came, the law was no longer needed. It was fulfilled. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many Christians today believe that Christianity is a set of rules and regulations that replaced the rules and regulations of the old law. They come up with lists of commands that Christians today have to follow; and when they can't find a place commanding something, they quickly find it "inferred" in another place. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This approach is wrong. Christianity is not another list of rules, it is a new approach to living. Christianity only requires you to adopt a goal: loving others. The old law and "regulations" found in the New Testament are helpful guides to achieving this, but they are no substitute for the real thing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is apparent when we look at the life of Jesus, who broke many rules. When confronted about it, he only replied that the laws were made for man, and not the other way around. When Jesus was in a situation where he had to choose between doing the "right" thing and helping people, he chose people every time. This is an amazing attitude coming from a religious leader, most of whom promote their own arbitrary dogmas as the absolute last word. Instead, Jesus stated that there were really only two laws: love God, and love man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Judaism (and all other religions until this point) had been focused on external rituals and complicated legal codes. Jesus cut through all of this to show what God truly wanted, demonstrating that all of the trappings of religion had just been trying to point man in that direction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although this is a hard concept to grasp for many people, it is a concept born out in many scriptures. It is only through millennia of false teaching that we have forgotten this. Jesus showed us that love was in fact the sum of all of God's commands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is the only thing God ever really required.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(PS. I suggest you read the following passages: Gal 6:2; Matt 22:36-40; Mark 12:28-32; Luke 10:26-27; John 13:34-35; Rom 13:8-10; Gal 5:14)&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/wonder-woman/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/wonder-woman/</link><pubDate>Mon Jul 03 19:00:00 CDT 2017</pubDate><title>Wonder Woman</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>For CS Lewis, Adam and Eve were a vision of humanity as it could be, in its full power and beauty.

In other ways, it's a self-imposed exile, in which we must slum around the world, often without food, showers, or the benefits of clean clothing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The terms of our exile are these:&lt;br/&gt;* 40 days, almost 6 weeks.&lt;br/&gt;* A meagre daily budget.&lt;br/&gt;* No cell service, no data, no texts.&lt;br/&gt;* Lodging at hostels, airports, and as provided by the kindness of strangers.&lt;br/&gt;* We don't speak any of the languages.&lt;br/&gt;* No firm plans.&lt;br/&gt;* We can't leave. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is the purpose of this trip?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first I thought maybe it was going to be trying to live cheaply in many different places. Then I thought maybe it was going to be seeing as many sights as we could in a short amount of time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But no. I'm discovering that this trip is about learning to survive and flourish in a world outside of our own. It is about figuring out the user interface for the rest of human-occupied existence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Language and currency are two big pieces of that user interface. But there are more: customs, subtle understandings about how responsibility is divided up between people, geography, ways of relating to foreigners, ways of communicating difficult ideas, friendliness vs respect for privacy, ways of running public transportation, understandings about safety, expectations - and what happens when expectations are disappointed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm not really sight-seeing. I'm picking up skill-sets, constructing mental maps, learning to figure things out, from whatever culture they emerge. I've learned how to negotiate with cabdrivers in Peru (I don't even know how to hail a cab in the States), how to sleep in an open air house in winter, how to communicate when I don't know the language, how to feel safe in places Americans are warned not to go, and how to protect myself when sleeping in buildings that feel like movie prison camps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This feels right. It feels good not to be afraid of what's out here - out beyond the edge of the world I know.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2008/08/05/about/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2008/08/05/about/</link><pubDate>Tue Aug 05 14:32:19 CDT 2008</pubDate><title>About</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>Micah Redding is a world-adventurer, philosopher, and songwriter.

This being small-town America, many of the business entries in the yellow pages put me directly through to someone's cellphone. So I would talk to these people for a while, then discover that their business was not open on Sundays, and they were just lounging around at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, forgive me for having lived in bigger cities, but I expect that if I call a store and it is not open, then I will get either no answer, or more likely, an answering machine that tells me the hours they ARE open.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ANYWAY, I was still calling music stores, and I finally called the last one in the book. This time, a guy answered, and told me he was in and out of his studio. He then proceeded to spend about 15-20 minutes rummaging through his stuff trying to find me some strings. Pretty soon, I decided to head out to his store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I followed the directions, I headed out past the mall, farther and farther out of town, and finally down a gravel driveway. Jumping out, I looked around for evidence of a studio. Instead, I saw a brick patio and a rickety set of wooden stairs leaned against a concrete slab, leading down into what appeared to be a cellar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We headed down to meet one of the most interesting guys I've ever bumped into.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His cellar was converted into a full recording studio, the walls crammed full of memorabilia and other instruments. He had one of the earliest instruments known to man. He had an amp used by Slash. He had a guitar he had designed, which Melissa Etheridge later made famous. He had a Flying-V ACOUSTIC guitar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And he had a toilet from 1920. With the wall-mounted flush box and everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is much more that could be said about this visit, but that one item about sums it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-micah&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2004/12/08/everybodys-records-concert-in-cincinnati-this-weekend/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2004/12/08/everybodys-records-concert-in-cincinnati-this-weekend/</link><pubDate>Wed Dec 08 03:24:00 CST 2004</pubDate><title>Everybody&amp;#039;s Records Concert in Cincinnati This Weekend</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>This Saturday, December 11th, at 4:00pm, we will be playing at Everybody's Records in Cincinnati.

Now I don't draw so hard a line; it's not that the environment isn't a character, it's that the character of the environment isn't really developed. Sure, the story is set in a location with robots and space ships, but the essentials of the location don't challenge us in any way. Han Solo is essentially a cowboy with a different set of horses and weapons. For this reason, Star Wars functions more as adventure than science fiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the environment of Pandora challenges us. It challenges us to imagine a different way of relating to the world itself. It challenges us to imagine human beings as aliens, and aliens as humane. It asks us why our world is not like that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good science fiction challenges us because it asks us to imagine alternate realities, either in the future, or in the past, or in the present. And for this reason, Christianity (and the world) needs to start paying attention to science fiction. If we are beings in the image of God, our divine role is to play a part in creating that which is &lt;i&gt;new&lt;/i&gt;. It is our identity, what we were created for. And creation starts with imagining.&amp;lt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the first century, Jesus' followers became convinced he had something to do with the creation of the earth. So convinced, in fact, that they rewrote Genesis 1 to involve Jesus (&lt;a href="/blog/2007/01/05/did-jesus-create-the-world-or-did-god"&gt;see John 1&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because what Jesus did in his time and place &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; creation. He envisioned a new world, not defined by temple or ritual, place or time, or even station of birth. And rest assured, what Jesus envisioned was as outlandish and imaginative as any science fiction has ever been. He imagined a world no one else could have envisioned; and his disciples watched as he brought it into being. If the job of divinity is to create, Jesus must have been divine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For us, then, we must start envisioning, imagining, and telling stories. Science fiction helps us to imagine, and we need all the help we can get. Our stories are creating the new world, and we need to tell them just as hard as we can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;ansfanw&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;h1&gt;newstoryproject&lt;/h1&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/tower-of-babel/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/tower-of-babel/</link><pubDate>Fri May 11 09:30:41 CDT 2018</pubDate><title>The Tower of Babel</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>Perhaps no biblical story has captivated people’s imaginations like the Tower of Babel.

In this story, a group of people get together to build a tower tall enough to reach heaven—from which they intend to launch an all-out war on God himself. God sees what the people are building, and furious at their hubris, destroys the tower, and condemns humanity to the Earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or something like that. That’s not really in the Bible, but it’s what a lot of people hear and repeat. It’s almost like they mashed up the Bible with Icarus, Prometheus, and Jack &amp;amp; the Beanstalk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And every time someone feels like humanity is advancing too fast, they pull out this story, and try to slap people down with it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In doing so, they may be unwittingly enacting the Sin of Babel themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The Tower to Nowhere&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Bible, the Tower of Babel has a context. When God created humanity, he created them in his image, made them godlike (Genesis 1:26-28), and instructed them to participate in his work, creating and cultivating the life of the world, just as he had done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Growing into that immense role would take time, though. The very first thing humanity had to do was to become a planetary species.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are God’s first instructions to humanity: be fruitful and multiply (so there would be more humans to help), and &lt;em&gt;fill the earth&lt;/em&gt;—so that the work could be truly global in scope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;God had given these instructions in Genesis 1, but after Noah’s flood, the mission was relaunched, and God reiterated these instructions to the people emerging from the Ark:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then God blessed Noah and his sons, saying to them, “Be fruitful and increase in number and &lt;strong&gt;fill the earth&lt;/strong&gt;.” (Genesis 9:1)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that’s exactly what humans started doing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But then someone had a different idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Come, let us build ourselves a city, with a tower that reaches to the heavens, so that we may make a name for ourselves; otherwise we will be &lt;strong&gt;scattered over the face of the whole earth&lt;/strong&gt;.” (Genesis 11:4)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s a lot going on here. Notice, first of all, they’re not setting out to build a tower, they’re setting out to build a &lt;em&gt;city&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the book of Genesis, this is a red flag—so far, the good guys are nomads, spreading out across the landscape, &lt;em&gt;filling the earth&lt;/em&gt;, while the bad guys are city-builders, murderous tyrants trying to batten down the hatches, surround themselves with walls, and hold their ground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bible’s first city-builder? Cain, right after he slew Abel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sure enough, there’s something very similar going on here. Why do they want this city, and why does this city need to have a tower? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to their own account, they’re doing this to make a name for themselves, so that they can avoid being &lt;em&gt;scattered over the face of the earth&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s a brilliant idea. If they make the most famous city ever, no one will ever want to leave. People will be so proud of where they’re from, no one will ever venture out to explore new possibilities or new places.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And here’s the crux of the problem. They were &lt;em&gt;supposed&lt;/em&gt; to be exploring new possibilities and new places. God had &lt;em&gt;just told them&lt;/em&gt; to scatter over the face of the earth. That was part of their mission, part of what they needed to do to keep growing, so they could become the planetary species God had always intended them to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;God wanted humanity to grow—these people wanted things to stay the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They were rejecting God’s mission of ongoing change and growth, and choosing instead to aggressively defend the ways things were.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/tower-of-babel"&gt;Defending the way things are, at the expense of a better future, is the Sin of Babel.&lt;/a&gt;{: .tweet-this}&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;God’s Answer to Tyranny&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the Lord came down to see the city and the tower the people were building. The Lord said, “If as one people speaking the same language they have begun to do this, then nothing they plan to do will be impossible for them.” (Genesis 11:5-6)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;They had started work on their project, and sure enough, God confirms that humanity was powerful enough to build these kinds of things. After all, God had &lt;em&gt;made&lt;/em&gt; them that powerful. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what’s God’s problem with this? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to what God says, the problem is not the tower—it’s that this tower indicates that &lt;em&gt;the rest&lt;/em&gt; of their plans are within reach. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Including the plan to never, ever leave. If they don’t want to fill the earth, they won’t. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The grand project God intended for the human race will come to an end right here, as they get absorbed in a project specifically designed to thwart God’s intentions for continued growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This wasn’t just a one-time issue. Even if God stopped this project, the next project would spring up, and the next, and the next. Humanity seems intent on defending the ways things are, at the expense of the much greater future God intends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What kind of society engages in grandiose building projects just to make itself famous? What kind of society is determined to make sure no one ever leaves? What kind of society would every Jewish family think of, when hearing a name that sounds like the root word of “Babylon”?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tyranny.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over and over in the biblical story, tyranny is what stands opposed to God’s plans for humanity. The tyranny of Egypt, Babylon, and Rome stand against newness and growth and life. Right here in the beginning, we’re seeing just how destructive this kind of tyranny can be—if nothing is done, it will erase the glorious future of the human race.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So God comes up with a plan of his own. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;God will introduce linguistic diversity into the human race. Diversity will disrupt tyranny, making it hard for there to be any single source of power. Without a single source of power, there will be a world of plurality and difference, and no one will ever be able to completely eradicate change. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/tower-of-babel"&gt;Diversity is God’s answer to tyranny.&lt;/a&gt;{: .tweet-this}&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s exactly what God does, introducing a diversity of languages. And so, as the story sums up, the project grinds to a halt, people go back to spreading and exploring, and humanity is &lt;em&gt;scattered over the face of the whole earth&lt;/em&gt; (Genesis 11:9).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just as God always intended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s remarkable what’s not here. God doesn’t destroy their tower. God doesn’t forbid them from building new towers. God doesn’t even forbid them from building cities—though a righteous city-builder will take a few more generations to come along. God doesn’t show any indication of being furious with them, let alone being afraid they’re about to storm his gates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The whole story is about this: Will humanity continue to spread out and grow, as God intended, or will they build power structures that defend the way things are, and resist the ongoing process of change?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;God, seeing that humans keep being drawn to oppressive power structures, introduces diversity as an answer to tyranny. God’s plan works, these growth-rejecting projects are thwarted, and humanity goes back to growing into a planetary species.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Reversing Babel&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s the end of the Babel story in Genesis. But it’s not really the end of the story in the Bible. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the New Testament, when the Christian church is launched on the day of Pentecost, the Tower of Babel is symbolically reversed. Where Babel marks the introduction of the confusion of different languages, Pentecost marks the beginning of a new unity, where everyone can understand each other. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pentecost doesn’t do this by eliminating all the diversity God introduced at Babel. Instead, it does this by equipping people to understand and appreciate that diversity. The brand-new Christians find that they can communicate in different languages, and understand people from far different backgrounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Babel was a moment when humanity turned in on itself, and threatened to become tyrannical, self-absorbed, and stagnant. With the introduction of diversity, God saved humanity from tyranny, and gave it back its mission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it came with a downside. Diversity cost humanity its unity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Pentecost, that dilemma is finally answered. In partnership with God, we can bring about greater unity through—and not in spite of—our diversity. In partnership with God, we can learn to understand and appreciate each other’s differences, and be stronger for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that’s all part of God’s plan for us to move beyond the way things are, toward the much greater future God intends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/subscribe"&gt;&amp;gt; Find out more about Christian Transhumanism.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/be-thou-my-vision-and-theosis/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/be-thou-my-vision-and-theosis/</link><pubDate>Sun May 20 17:50:33 CDT 2018</pubDate><title>Be Thou My Vision, the Royal Wedding &amp; Theosis</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>At the Royal Wedding yesterday, there was a brief moment when everyone in attendance, including the royal couple, sang together.

They were singing a melody shared by &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VpSqAcLrDI&amp;index=36&amp;t=0s&amp;list=PL-S97LROgRNzo--DO8vVoRMQXFnBPYXXw"&gt;Be Thou My Vision&lt;/a&gt;, one of the most beautiful hymns ever written. The hymn has origins deep in Irish history—perhaps even tracing back to Saint Patrick himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what may be even more beautiful than the haunting Celtic melody, is the profound meaning of its lyrics. This song, more than any other I can think of, evokes the ancient Christian concept of &lt;em&gt;theosis&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theosis&lt;/em&gt; literally means “divinization”. In Christian thought, it means becoming a “partaker of the divine nature” (2 Peter 1:4)—being united with God, such that God’s nature permeates and transforms your own. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is what we enact in Communion or Eucharist, symbolically consuming Christ’s body and blood, that we may be transformed into Christ’s body and blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is why Christ came, according to the church fathers. &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divinization_(Christian)#Patristic_writings"&gt;“God became what we are, that we might become what he is.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most poignant statements about this is in Paul’s second letter to the Corinthians:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;And we all, who with unveiled faces contemplate the Lord’s glory, are being transformed into his image with ever-increasing glory, which comes from the Lord, who is the Spirit. (2 Corinthians 3:18)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The image is of vision—of seeing face to face. In ancient times, according to Paul, people had covered their faces when approaching God. They could not see him, could not understand him. There was no intimate relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They longed to cross that chasm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/my-grandfather"&gt;My eyes shall see him, mine and not another&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, echo the heart-wrenching words of Job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the biblical story, humans were made in the image of God, made to reflect God’s glory to all creation. Thus, to see God dimly, through a covering, was to be disconnected from what we really are. It was to fall short of the glory of God. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+corinthians+13:12&amp;version=NIV"&gt;Now we see as in mirror—then we shall see face to face.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Christ, according to Paul, that covering has been ripped away. Now, we can look at God face to face. Now, in contemplating God, we are transformed into a vision of God.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every relationship transforms us. We become part of the other person, and they become part of us. We become increasingly like each other. The more clearly we see the other person, the more deeply they become part of who we are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To see God face-to-face is to be in a relationship deeper and more intimate than you can imagine. It is to know that God is within you, transforming you into God’s image and glory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The desire to look upon God, to have that relationship fill you and transform you in every way, to feel it as deep as love, and as strong as power—is what this song is about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be Thou my Vision, O Lord of my heart;&lt;br/&gt;Naught be all else to me, save that Thou art.&lt;br/&gt;Thou my best Thought, by day or by night,&lt;br/&gt;Waking or sleeping, Thy presence my light. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be Thou my Wisdom, and Thou my true Word;&lt;br/&gt;I ever with Thee and Thou with me, Lord;&lt;br/&gt;Thou my great Father, I Thy true son;&lt;br/&gt;Thou in me dwelling, and I with Thee one. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be Thou my battle Shield, Sword for the fight;&lt;br/&gt;Be Thou my Dignity, Thou my Delight;&lt;br/&gt;Thou my soul’s Shelter, Thou my high Tower:&lt;br/&gt;Raise Thou me heavenward, O Power of my power. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Riches I heed not, nor man’s empty praise,&lt;br/&gt;Thou mine Inheritance, now and always:&lt;br/&gt;Thou and Thou only, first in my heart,&lt;br/&gt;High King of Heaven, my Treasure Thou art. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High King of Heaven, my victory won,&lt;br/&gt;May I reach Heaven’s joys, O bright Heaven’s Sun!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Heart of my own heart&lt;/em&gt;, whatever befall,&lt;br/&gt;Still be my Vision, O Ruler of all. &lt;/p&gt;

Her lyrics tear you apart line by line, only to build you back again with verse after verse of surgically precise digs and strokes.

I grew up in Georgia listening to my dads old Creedance Clearwater Revival and James Taylor records and until I was about 13 I had absolutely no idea that there was any other music besides this...yes...I was sheltered. When I started playing guitar it was because I was a skinny little white kid and the girls didn't like me...football was out...so i figured...maybe if I played guitar. Yeah...no artsy, I wanna change the way things work reasons...it was all for the chicks. Really that's what it comes down to for most musicians whether they want to admit it or not. Well the girls still didn't like me...sad day...so I started writing songs about it and then it began...no...no...no...not the girls liking me...the songwriting thing. So here I am today living in Nashville Tennessee trying to convince people to listen to my music and give me money for CD's. My music is a "montage" (my word of the day) of those old classics my dad had, mixed with some more recent influences. People say I sound like John Mayer and Jason Mraz alot...I dont really see it that much but its cool if they do. Another one of my friends said I sound like an American version of Travis...which is really cool cause those guys rock! Anyway...I like my music...its not meant to be artsy or techincally difficult with secret meanings and all that jazz. It is meant to be simple... catchy...songs that will get stuck in your head...songs for first dates or last dates...songs for sunny days lying on your back in a park or rainy days driving in your car...they are singing in the shower songs...thats what I do...I make the songs you sing in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.gentrymorris.com/"&gt;www.gentrymorris.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mayflye are an acoustic rock quartet based in Murfreesboro, TN. Comprised of four regular guys with day jobs and cell-phone bills, Mayflye spend their free time writing melodic rock songs with a verve that is often unseen in the contemporary acoustic genre today. Initially founded by fellow MTSU alumni, Gregory Castillo, Matt Frasher, and John Sorrels began writing songs together on the bottom floor of a poorly ventilated Murfreesboro apartment complex in early 2004. Later that spring and in need of a bassist, they joined forces with perhaps the most unlikely of characters, David Castro, a Columbian refugee with little to no experience as a bass player. In a brilliant display of confidence, David picked up the bass and earned his way into the band, dazzling its members with his obvious knack for melody and rhythmic poise. Since then, Mayflye have been determined to further their abilities and broaden their musical tact by flirting with a variety of new styles and even new instruments. So, is it possible that you will see a Mayflye post-hardcore polka-funk album in the near future? You never know. You just might.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.myspace.com/mayflye"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.myspace.com/mayflye"&gt;http://www.myspace.com/mayflye&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2007/06/09/a-few-more-thoughts-on-the-problem-of-evil/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2007/06/09/a-few-more-thoughts-on-the-problem-of-evil/</link><pubDate>Sat Jun 09 10:56:00 CDT 2007</pubDate><title>(A Few) More Thoughts on The Problem of Evil</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>It's been a few days since I published my answer to The Problem of Evil, and I've gotten some interesting responses.

I didn't realize when I set out to write it how much it would affect me. Thanks to &lt;a href="http://transmillennial.blogspot.com/"&gt;Kevin&lt;/a&gt;, and his pointing out the significance of Isaiah and "God creating evil", I realized that not only does a proper solution to &lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/2007/05/27/the-problem-of-evil-part-1-the-unanswered-question"&gt;The Problem of Evil&lt;/a&gt; serve to show that God is not a logical contradiction, but it also points us towards a much much bigger view of God than that typically allowed by contemporary churches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;God is paradoxically the unambiguous source of good and evil, pain, suffering, and joy; and yet manages to be uncompromisingly all-loving and all-good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real Christian view of God has always been that God is not just omnipresent, but SO omnipresent, that EVERYTHING that happens is the work of God. The grass grows by his direct operation, the rain falls by his command. Of course, this points us towards a new understanding of what God is...but I'll deal with that later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I laid out my solution to The Problem over three pages (I wanted it to be understood), let me sum it up right here:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. God is Love&lt;br /&gt;2. Love wants the loved one to not suffer&lt;br /&gt;3. But Love wants the loved one to LIVE even more&lt;br /&gt;4. God allows all beings to live, even beings that are hurt, or psychologically damaged, or just have had bad experiences. These beings may ask God, "why did you make me suffer?" And God's answer would be, "Because I loved you and wanted you to live."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This line of argument makes sense if we accept a few things:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Existence is better than non-existence.&lt;br /&gt;2. An individual is a collection of thoughts, feelings, experiences, and memories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some have argued that #1 is not the case, that for some individuals, it would have been better to have never existed. But what does Love mean? Love means that we want the best for the one we love. It is nonsensical to think that Love could ever want the object of its love to not exist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it is nonsensical to think that ANY entity could wish itself not to come into existence. I would even argue that it is nonsensical for any entity which exists to wish to stop existing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People who are suicidal (and I have been), seem to picture death as either some kind of heaven, or some kind of rest. But non-existence is not rest. It is not anything. One can't logically say "I would be happier if I didn't exist". Happiness is not a property of non-existent beings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neither can one logically say "I would be less depressed if I didn't exist". Degrees of anything don't apply to non-existent beings. Trying to compare existence to non-existence in this way is the philosophical equivalent of dividing by zero - it makes no sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saying something is better off (when it doesn't even exist) is not even false - it just has no meaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my own personal value system, the worst evil of all is non-existence. Even death is not as bad as non-existence, because the person who died DID exist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I haven't made as strong a case for this as I would like. What do you think?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-micah&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2011/11/23/introduction-simulation-argument/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2011/11/23/introduction-simulation-argument/</link><pubDate>Wed Nov 23 09:39:09 CST 2011</pubDate><title>An Introduction to the Simulation Argument</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>In 2003, Nick Bostrom published his [Simulation Argument](http://www.simulation-argument.com/), and shook the landscape of philosophy.

We created Simcity, and then the Sims, and then one after another, a barrage of increasingly realistic video games. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can only imagine this trend will continue. Our games and simulated worlds will become more and more complex, more and more concrete, more and more capable of deceiving us into believing they are reality. Until one day, they do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometime in the future, we will manage to create a simulation that will convince us, in every way, that it is real. It may not happen until 2050, or 2150, or til the year 3000. But it is almost certain that we will eventually do so, and that once we've done it, we will do it over and over and over again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the things that we will simulate is our own past. After all, we currently play Oregon Trail, and make slideshows out of our old photo albums. Why wouldn't we try to experience them as in-depth as possible? Why stop with photos and video? Why not re-live the past as it really was?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the next million years or so, we will have created trillions upon trillions of such simulations, including an unimaginable number that simulate this moment right now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if the number of people experiencing this moment as a simulation is in the millions or trillions, and the number of people experiencing this moment as &lt;em&gt;reality&lt;/em&gt; is just &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt;, then we have to ask ourselves whether or not we are, in fact, in the &lt;em&gt;simulation&lt;/em&gt; right now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, it's obvious that if we accept the above sequence of events, then the probability that we are in a simulation is overwhelming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can and should generalize this argument. The basic premise is that in all realities (whether past, future, in other galaxies or in other universes) where sufficiently capable intelligent beings exist, they will create an almost infinite number of simulated worlds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; reality which allows simulated worlds to exist, the simulated worlds will outnumber the real worlds, trillions to one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus, the vast majority of beings will exist in simulated worlds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And every intelligent being should make the assumption that their world is a simulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are two basic objections to this idea, which leads to what I describe as the trilemma: &lt;strong&gt;Suicide, Censorship, or Simulation&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first one (suicide), argues that these virtual worlds never come into existence because every intelligent civilization ultimately destroys itself before becoming capable of such simulations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If this is true, then we should expect that humanity will die out in the very near future, probably before the end of the century.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second one (censorship), argues that all intelligent beings will see these simulated worlds as being unethical, and will permanently ban all such technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note that for this to impact the argument, it's not sufficient that one country or species ban the practice. It actually requires that every country, every race, every species in every world, ban the practice for all eternity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This brings us to the third scenario. If intelligent species don't all die out, and if they don't all ban the practice, then we're left with the inevitable conclusion: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Virtual worlds outnumber real worlds, and we're living in somebody's simulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;What are we to make of this? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have more to say on the subject, but I think the basic idea holds firm. This isn't the traditional "maybe the world is a dream" musing, which starts with doubt about what we know and experience. This argument starts with the assumption that the world as we know it makes sense, and ends up concluding that if so, then the world as we know it isn't real.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this brings us to a question about what &lt;em&gt;reality&lt;/em&gt; really means. And that's what I want to talk about next.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2015/12/31/what-i-would-write/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2015/12/31/what-i-would-write/</link><pubDate>Thu Dec 31 10:09:43 CST 2015</pubDate><title>What I Would Write</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>Right now, my mind is a flurry of thoughts, ideas, and questions.

This is typical for me, at this time of year, when there’s downtime, when everything is nominally starting over, when I’m reconnecting with my family, and resetting my expectations about life along the way. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With my family, that reset is usually in the direction of the surreal. My grip on conventional reality is loosened, and I start to imagine fresh new possibilities and ways of living.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had another reset recently, on a speaking trip to Nigeria — fifteen hours of flight time each way, and a world both hauntingly familiar and uniquely alien on the other side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through all of this, one of the questions that has been haunting me is: &lt;em&gt;if I had unlimited time to write, what would I write about?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The answer would surely have to include the thing that provoked the question in the first place—the sense that life is open-ended, that the world is full of untapped possibility. To tap into that sense, I turn to my favorite subjects: religion, &lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/2013/06/07/iron-man-and-modern-identity-crisis"&gt;science fiction&lt;/a&gt;, imagination, story-telling, &lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/2015/03/13/what-technology"&gt;technology&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/2014/12/20/spaceships-christmas"&gt;space travel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For me, these subjects all point to something about life itself: that it is constantly unfolding, that it wants to be free, that it is gnarly and diverse and unpredictable, rather than secure and stable and constrained. This is, in fact, what we mean by &lt;em&gt;life&lt;/em&gt;. The opposite of these things is stagnation, and the ultimate form of stagnation is &lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/03/06/why-are-humans-evil"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To choose life is to choose improvisation. To choose life is to choose to face new challenges, and to be provoked to create new solutions to them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many ways we can shirk that responsibility, draw back from the edge, retreat into our &lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/2013/05/28/poison-empires"&gt;fortresses&lt;/a&gt; and hovels and holes. If we do that for too long, we end up in a kind of living death, having traded in possibility for security, and opportunity for stasis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, this is a fool’s bargain, because the only real security is in actually living, and for the person who prioritizes security—even what they have is eventually taken from them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given life’s bias towards improvisation, the skills we most need in this world seem to be things like &lt;em&gt;play&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;imagination&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;creativity&lt;/em&gt;. This is where science fiction and story-telling and space travel come into play. These are the tools we use to fire up our imaginations, to ignite our creativity, to remind us of the possibilities of &lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/2013/01/21/gardeners-stars"&gt;new worlds&lt;/a&gt;. We need these things, now more than ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if &lt;em&gt;play&lt;/em&gt; is important, so are games. One of the best descriptions of life I have ever encountered is the concept of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_and_Infinite_Games"&gt;finite and infinite games&lt;/a&gt;. Finite games you play to win. Infinite games you play to keep playing. Football is a finite game, while dress-up is an infinite one. ‘Run for President’ is a finite game, while ‘Write books’ is an infinite one. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, &lt;em&gt;life itself&lt;/em&gt; is the most infinite game of all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we think of life as an infinite game, where our ultimate objective is to keep playing, keep including new people, keep making it more and more fun for everyone — then we’re suddenly in the domain of religion. That, I would argue, is what religion really is: a focus on life at the largest scales, at the most extreme reaches we can imagine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At these scales, we can only speak in images and metaphor. At these scales, we can only point and hypothesize. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, of course religion and science aren’t quite on the same page right now. Science helps us see the next few steps ahead. Religion asks us to lift up our eyes to the hills…to the stars…to whatever’s beyond that. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the gospels, someone asks Jesus &lt;em&gt;what must I do to inherit eternal life?&lt;/em&gt; We might also ask, &lt;em&gt;what must we do to play the infinite game?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think the answer to both of these questions is the same. One of the ways Jesus expresses that answer is this: &lt;em&gt;become like a little child&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Learn to play. Learn to see reality as open-ended. Remind ourselves of other worlds. Dream and imagine and create. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s what I think I want to write about. It’s a new year. It’s time to blow the roof off of reality, roll up our sleeves, and get busy playing.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2006/12/11/container-lust-the-pursuit-of-the-most-glorious-container/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2006/12/11/container-lust-the-pursuit-of-the-most-glorious-container/</link><pubDate>Mon Dec 11 06:36:00 CST 2006</pubDate><title>Container Lust - the pursuit of the most glorious container</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>Perhaps I should explain something about myself that some people may not know.I am obsessed with containers.That's right, containers.

Of all kinds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For example, my room is filled with large, Sterilite brand, 18-gallon boxes. I use them for storing old clothes, old papers, mementos, band equipment, band merchandise, anything. They hold up marvelously, stack great, last forever, and look spiffy with their cool shade of grey. These are truly the Kings among men in the world of containers. No other brand or type matches these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I have the smaller containers for storing stacks of cassettes (yes, I still have some old cassettes!), files, etc. They recognize their place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, my window-sill is packed tight with several rows of heavy-duty pencil boxes stuffed to the brim with tools, widgets, and knick-knacks; some modified sandwich containers; a very large Altoids tin; a full-size former Folgers bucket; and a bunch of speciality AOL CD cases. All of these containers are being fully utilized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that's not to mention the stuff I have for our band equipment!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I walk down the aisles at Walmart (they have the best containers), my friends understand when I veer suddenly in the direction of the storage section. When I travel to new towns, I scour their thrift stores for old luggage; the kind with the hard-shell, the ugly green or brown coloring, and the scent of the 70s still lingering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it's an addiction, it's a good one. After all, you can never have too many containers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-micah&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.reddingbrothers.com/"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.reddingbrothers.com/"&gt;http://www.reddingbrothers.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2004/01/24/roughdraft-sold-out-01232004/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2004/01/24/roughdraft-sold-out-01232004/</link><pubDate>Sat Jan 24 03:22:00 CST 2004</pubDate><title>RoughDraft sold out - 01/23/2004</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>CHARLESTON, WV - The Redding Brothers' self-produced demo album "Rough Draft" has now officially sold out!

This community revolves around re-visualizing the artist as the small business-person. And it has done some pretty important things, notably spreading the ideas that you don't need a "music executive" to give you permission to make music, and that it's perfectly acceptable for artists to make money from their art.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are some examples of this movement:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.musicmarketing.com/"&gt;David Hooper - music business&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bob-baker.com/"&gt;Bob Baker - music business advisor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.scottandrew.com/"&gt;Scott Andrew - diy musician&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But after listening to these ideas for several years now, I'm starting to feel like something's missing. They're good ideas. I just need something more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After all, I became a performing musician so I could influence others, and share my songs and ideas with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I'm re-thinking what it means to be a musician. And I'm thinking of a new model for independent music.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Musicians as instigators.&lt;br /&gt;Songs as powerful ideas.&lt;br /&gt;Bands as causes.&lt;br /&gt;Concerts as actualized change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is how I've thought for some time now. Only now, I see it more clearly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My role as musician is to be an instigator or catalyst of change. My songs are the pieces of time and tone that encapsulate the powerful feelings and ideas of change. My band is a cause to be believed in. My concerts are moments when our vision becomes actualized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the concert and the listeners and the audience...that is the music becoming community.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2004/08/15/espresso-euphoria-08142004/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2004/08/15/espresso-euphoria-08142004/</link><pubDate>Sun Aug 15 02:27:00 CDT 2004</pubDate><title>Espresso Euphoria - 08/14/2004</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>This weekend, Saturday the 14th (7-9pm), the Reddings will deliver a 2-hour performance at Espresso Euphoria in Barboursville, on Route 60, the exit right after (west of) the Huntington Mall.

At least, not ones that involve healing amputees. Not ones that involve big obvious moves on his part. And yet we claim that he did these very things in the past. Always in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We hold up thousands of examples of "answered prayers", and yet all of these "answers" occur only when they are non-impossible things. Only when they are things that could happen without our prayers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The author of the linked website poses a "&lt;a href="http://whywontgodhealamputees.com/god3.htm"&gt;Standard Model of God&lt;/a&gt;", and proceeds to show that this model of God cannot represent something that really exists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Prayer is extremely important. People believe that we can pray to God (or Jesus) (sometimes even Mary and certain saints) and God hears our prayers. People believe that God reaches down into our world and uses his infinite power and love to answer our prayers. God will intervene to cure diseases. God can save our lives in emergency situations. God will protect us from danger. God can solve a wide range of personal problems and make our lives better through prayer. Hundreds of millions of people pray to God daily, and they believe that God hears their prayers. According to many people, God is answering millions of prayers on earth every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree with the author that the above-described God does not exist, cannot exist. An all-loving, infinitely powerful God that can (and does) intervene any time he wants, yet chooses to ignore amputees, September 11th, millions of victims of various sorts, etc...does not make sense. Something is wrong in that equation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don't understand why, read the above-mentioned website. Now, I have addressed &lt;a href="http://emergentchristian.blogspot.com/2007/05/problem-of-evil-part-1-unanswered.html"&gt;The Problem of Evil&lt;/a&gt; already. But my answer points the way to a different understanding of what God is. The conventional answers to The Problem of Evil typically hold up a view of God which is notably dated, to - say - the 19th century. Much of modern Christianity labors under a view of God which is neither current nor ancient - which derives neither from modern insights to the universe, nor from biblical revelation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Such a viewpoint may be great for establishing churches and such, but it is not great for coming to a better understanding of our place in the universe, or for making sense out of our religious teachings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So WHAT is God?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is he an alien being in space? A deistic watchmaker outside of space and time? A force pervading the universe and binding us all together? A being living in a parallel dimensionality? A cartoonish old man in the clouds?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You tell me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-micah&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2006/05/07/clouds-mp3/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2006/05/07/clouds-mp3/</link><pubDate>Sun May 07 14:37:00 CDT 2006</pubDate><title>Clouds MP3</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>Listen to the newly recorded version of Clouds:Stream it-micah...</description><content:encoded>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Listen to the newly recorded version of Clouds:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.reddingbrothers.com/sound/stream/clouds.m3u"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stream it&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-micah&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/women-in-the-church/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/women-in-the-church/</link><pubDate>Mon Jun 20 10:22:12 CDT 2016</pubDate><title>Women in the Church</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>If you, like me, grew up in a “Bible-believing church”, one thing that might have been discussed is the question of what role women could play in church services.

You might have been told, for example, that the Bible clearly teaches women to be silent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe you accept that, and can’t understand how anyone would see things differently. Maybe you no longer feel like you can accept that, but don’t know what to do with certain passages. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let me state my biases and assumptions up front.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If I were studying Buddhism or Islam, and they told me that separation between men and women was an essential part of their religion (as they do), I would accept that. I wouldn’t see it as my place to challenge the traditions that had been passed down. I would recognize that within those religions, there were certain practices that might differ significantly from the outside world. And if I had decided to pursue that religion, I would be okay with that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, as a Christian, if I believed that God had commanded separate roles for men and women, I would accept that. Or if I thought that separate roles for men and women was the earliest tradition of the church, I wouldn’t see it as my role to challenge that practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this leads to the fundamental question: What &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; Christianity teach on the issue? What &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; the scriptures indicate was the practice of the church from the earliest times?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I believe that the New Testament clearly teaches that women and men were to be given equal roles in the church, and that this practice of equality was understood as a command of God.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therefore, just as I wouldn’t consider it my place to challenge a command of God, or to change a tradition passed down, I do not consider it acceptable for the modern church to do so either. Establishing separate roles for men and women is a rejection of a core New Testament teaching, and an abandonment of one of the key distinguishing features of scriptural Christianity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I recognize that this is a big claim. And I recognize that there are many other related issues, including gender, marriage, and so on. But in the spirit of a &lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/minimum-viable-theology-good-wins"&gt;Minimum Viable Theology&lt;/a&gt;, I want to sandbox those for a moment, and focus on the clearest and simplest question: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Did the early Christians allow women to speak in the church?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The answer is obviously yes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Christianity is introduced to the world&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the day of Pentecost, as the Holy Spirit is poured out on the disciples, Peter gets up to explain to the crowd what is happening. He then delivers the first Christian sermon. This sermon explains the story of Jesus and of Israel, declares the New Covenant, and invites his listeners to join them. Here is how he starts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Fellow Jews and all of you who live in Jerusalem, let me explain this to you; listen carefully to what I say. These people are not drunk, as you suppose. It’s only nine in the morning! No, this is what was spoken by the prophet Joel:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“‘In the last days, God says,&lt;br/&gt; I will pour out my Spirit on all people.&lt;br/&gt;Your sons and daughters will prophesy,&lt;br/&gt; your young men will see visions,&lt;br/&gt; your old men will dream dreams.&lt;br/&gt;Even on my servants, both men and women,&lt;br/&gt; I will pour out my Spirit in those days,&lt;br/&gt; and they will prophesy.” (Acts 2:14-18)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a lot going on here. But right here, in the very first moment of Christianity, we have a clear and unambiguous statement: The sign of Christianity was that both men and women would equally possess the Spirit of God, and equally use that Spirit to prophesy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This wasn’t incidental. This was a prophesy given in the Old Testament, and reiterated in the New Testament. It was introduced as the launching point of the New Covenant. It was God’s declaration of what he would do in Christianity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then, at the end of Peter’s sermon, Peter extends the invitation to everyone:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. And you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. The promise is for you and your children and for all who are far off—for all whom the Lord our God will call.” (Acts 2:38-39) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of them would receive the gift of the Holy Spirit, and participate in this dramatic process. The promise that God would pour out his Spirit on all people, both male and female, was for them and everyone who came after them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notice how he connects this gift to baptism? We’re going to come back to that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, I realize that “prophecy” is not a category most of us are familiar with, and so this might be a bit of a cognitive hangup. For our purposes, though, it’s quite simple: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prophecy is declaring the message of God, and speaking authoritatively with the Spirit of God.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is, quite simply, the most authoritative role you could play within the early church. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Did the early Christians allow women to speak in the church? The answer is obviously yes. It’s not just &lt;em&gt;allowed&lt;/em&gt;, it’s an essential part of what Christianity is about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Women prophesy to men&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Significantly, Peter is not just saying that this &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; happen. He is saying it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; happening!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Peter stands up, he is explaining a bizarre sight. There were approximately 120 disciples (Acts 1:15), including women (Acts 1:14), and they were all together in one place (Acts 1:15; 2:1). When the Holy Spirit is poured out, they all start speaking in the languages of people from “every nation under heaven”. The onlookers are baffled. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peter then stands up with the Eleven other apostles, and explains that these people were not drunk. Instead, “*This* is what was spoken by the prophet Joel…”. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peter was explaining the sight, by claiming that it could be understood by reference to Joel’s prophecy. In other words, he is explaining what they are seeing: “Sons and daughters…men and women…” — all with the Spirit, all prophesying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In front of men from every nation under heaven.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it is supposed that the only people prophesying here were the Twelve (or Eleven) apostles. This seems very unlikely. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, there are the pronouns: “they were all” (Acts 2:1) seems to indicate all the disciples, as does “these people” (Acts 2:15), while “the Eleven” (Acts 2:14) indicates when it is just the apostles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, about fifteen of the “nations under heaven” are listed off, strongly indicating that there were at least that many disciples speaking the various languages. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Third, Peter’s statement to the crowd makes very little sense if they were &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; in fact seeing men and women, sons and daughters, all prophesying. If there were only twelve men prophesying, why start with a passage about how “all people” including men and women, would prophesy? Why tell the crowd that these twelve men were somehow fulfilling this prophesy about “sons and daughters”? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No, Peter is describing what the crowd is seeing, and declaring that this is exactly what Joel prophesied: sons and daughters, men and women, all prophesying with the Spirit of God.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Did the early Christians allow women to speak in the church? The answer is obviously yes. Did the early Christians allow women to speak in front of men? The answer, again, is obviously yes. It’s not just allowed, it’s the first thing that happens in Christianity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Some objections&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objection: This was not a church service.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brothers and sisters, this was the first church service! But if somehow that were unclear, we do not have to look very hard to confirm that prophesy was an intrinsic part of what happened in the church (1 Corinthians 14:4-ff), and that women were included in that (1 Corinthians 11:5: “…every woman who prays or prophesies…”).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objection: Women were allowed to prophesy, but only in women-only church services.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no indication in the scripture of any women-only church services. As we’ve already seen, Peter indicates that women were already prophesying to men in Acts 2. Further, Paul discusses women prophesying to men in 1 Corinthians 11:1-16, in the same context as his discussion of the Lord’s Supper. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objection: Women were allowed to prophesy, but weren’t allowed to exercise any other public role, like praying in public.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, we know that women exercised many other gifts and public roles, including praying in public, and that the New Testament authors applied exactly the same standards to prophecy as they did to public prayer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1 Corinthians 11:1-16, Paul discusses the etiquette of the mixed-gender situation in which women were both praying and prophesying. His discussion is entirely dependent on there being both men and women there, and in this scenario, he applies exactly the same standards to women who prophesy as he does to women who pray.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Every man who prays or prophesies…every woman who prays or prophesies…” (1 Corinthians 11:4-5)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Did the early Christians allow women to speak in the church?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;YES! Obviously, clearly, unambiguously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even the objections raised do not really dispute this—they only seek to put some qualifications on it. But such suggestions not only have no scriptural basis, they introduce countless absurdities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is much more to discuss, and other passages to cover. But for someone who wants to honestly read the scriptures, this much is clear. Women were speaking in the church, exercising the most authoritative and powerful spiritual gift, from the earliest moments of Christianity. This fact was prophesied before Jesus, and boldly proclaimed in the first Christian sermon. It is an inescapable aspect of the New Covenant, and an unmistakeable sign of Biblical Christianity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Equal participation of men and women is a core ideal of Christianity. Equal participation of men and women was a biblical sign of God’s work. Equal participation of men and women was central to the first moments of the Christian story.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I know, I'm late on this one. The first book came out in 1995, and the movie caused a big uproar last Christmas. And I'm just reading last year's controversy now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reason that it's controversial, of course, is that it's about two kids killing God.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Except that isn't true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm big on people being honest when they spread malicious accusations around; so I want to set the record straight on a few things, just to clear the air. I'm not saying the book wouldn't be controversial anyway...I'd just like the controversy to be about the right things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First of all, the kids don't kill God. They do find him confused and afraid, and let him out of a crystal cage he's been kept in for thousands of years. When they do, they're surprised to see him evaporate in the wind, due to his extreme old age. And he is peaceful and happy about being released from his misery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The kids are just trying to help an old man.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The parents of the kids, however, DID try to wage a war against heaven. This war brings Enoch, the reigning tyrant of the universe, into battle. Enoch is the guy who took over God's role, and keeps God in a cage. Enoch ends up getting killed by the parents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, to summarize: kids help out an old man, God dies of old age, Enoch is killed by the kids' parents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NOW...it should be obvious that the "God" that dies here is not the God described in the bible. In fact, the book is explicit that this is a false god, an old angel who set himself up and claimed to be God. He floats around in something called Cloud Mountain, and terrorizes the universe. As he gets old and feeble (in this book, even angels age), he gradually turns his duties over to Enoch, who is much harsher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So there's the story.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2009/12/13/jesus-is-lord/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2009/12/13/jesus-is-lord/</link><pubDate>Sun Dec 13 20:20:00 CST 2009</pubDate><title>Jesus is Lord</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>This is my rough take on a series of very complex subjects.

Be warned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most threatening enemies of early Christianity was gnosticism. And gnosticism was a threat for a very solid reason: it offered answers, and good ones. When people asked "why evil?", gnosticism could respond that the physical world itself was evil. In contrast, authentic Christianity could only respond with a shrug and an "I don't know".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this reason, gnosticism never fully released its grip on the Christian mindset. Where Christianity requires a difficult balance over a dynamic tension, gnosticism rids one of mental struggles by supplying very complete answers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the white-hot center of the first Christian-gnostic dispute was the physicality of Jesus. Where gnosticism held that Jesus only "seemed" physical, Christianity required looking at Jesus' real, physical body as somehow being divine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gnosticism looked for spiritual freedom in knowledge. Specifically, gnosticism looked for freedom in arcane knowledge, hidden knowledge, knowledge that specified the hidden mapping of metaphysical beings. By having the correct metaphysical map, one could ensure they were following the right path to salvation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are shades of this in Christianity today. Flipping through Christian radio, I hear "Jesus is Lord" roll out endlessly. And yet I have the impression that to many of them, saying "Jesus is Lord" simply means that we have the correct name scribbled in the empty spot on our map for "ruler in the sky".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a far cry from what that declaration meant to early Christians. In contrast to the gnostics, the early Christians weren't challenging Zeus or Krishna or Thor for the metaphysical throne in the sky. Their challenge was far more scandalous, far scarier. They were challenging the real-world idols of Caesar and the temple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the early Christians, Jesus was always seen through his physical life. And his physical life led to a confrontation between himself and the forces of violence and power that ruled his world. In the crucifixion, Rome and Jerusalem had focused their entire rage and violence on shattering and destroying Jesus. And the scandalous declaration of the early Christians was that Jesus had won!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even the resurrection, for Paul, has meaning in light of the crucifixion. Jesus had triumphed over his enemies on the cross, and the resurrection was simply the announcement of this accomplished fact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To say "Jesus is Lord" meant that turning the other cheek was more powerful than wielding a sword. It meant that kneeling to touch a Samaritan woman was unleashing a force stronger than Caesar's grand slave squadrons. And it meant that dying on a cross was an ultimate triumph that outshone every military victory Rome and Jerusalem could boast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This declaration of the triumph of Jesus in the physical world is dramatically different than any kind of religious claim about mapping metaphysical reality. And it's far more powerful and scandalous than the anemic declarations of religious sentiment that roll off the tongue during this time of year.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2005/06/09/drinking-only-water/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2005/06/09/drinking-only-water/</link><pubDate>Thu Jun 09 16:14:00 CDT 2005</pubDate><title>Drinking only water</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>About three weeks ago, Josiah, Gabe, and I decided to stop drinking soda, milk, juice, etc, and start drinking only water.

My thoughts were that I was tired of waking up exhausted and having to drink caffeine to get through the day, only to feel even worse afterwards. I figured that if I was waking up exhausted, I needed to focus on getting enough sleep the night before, and I suspected that if I drank enough water, I wouldn't need caffeine, and might feel even better. So Gabe pressured us to make a pact to drink only water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a result, I inadvertently lost 15 pounds in three weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And all without counting calories, dieting, or ceasing from eating junk food at the local convenience store. And losing weight really wasn't on my immediate "to-do list" either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are several things that have struck me since deciding to do this. One is that I had the habit of getting hungry, and then dealing with my hunger by drinking soda. Even eating a candy bar probably has less calories and more nutrition than soda. And when you drink something, it may make you full for a while, but you'll soon be just as hungry. Replacing meals with sugar-water is a bad idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not a calorie issue either. I would often drink diet soda; it too is filling, but leaves you feeling even more hungry than regular soda. So it tends to cause over-eating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other thing that struck me is how water tends to fix your ailments. I haven't really done much better on getting sleep; I've made a lot of trips lately where I'm getting in at 3:30am and getting up at 7:00am. But when I drink a lot of water, it makes me feel more alert than caffeinated soda does. And in general, it just seems like I've felt better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This wasn't the easiest decision for me to make. Just like Gabe, I tend to drink ALL the time. I have to drink or chew on something. And my ideal situation would be to not ever have to eat and just be able to drink smoothies all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But there is something philosophical to be said about eating when you're hungry, drinking when you're thirsty, and not screwing that equation up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Water is THE drink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-micah&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2006/05/07/clouds-the-song-2/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2006/05/07/clouds-the-song-2/</link><pubDate>Sun May 07 17:30:00 CDT 2006</pubDate><title>Clouds, the song</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>When I was in college, I spent a lot of time studying the events that happened in the first century.

We believe that we should not be content with simply reacting to things as they happen, but should be actively involved in shaping and growing new possibilities in the world. We believe that the provocative biblical understanding of humanity is a powerful vision and a gift that should be shared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For all of these reasons, we think that it is time for Christian Transhumanists to step forward and invite others to join with us in imagining, expressing, and working towards our best dreams for the world and the future. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If any of this resonates with you, let's continue the discussion: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.christiantranshumanism.org/"&gt;Interested in Christian Transhumanism?&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2016/02/04/faith-of-the-martian/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2016/02/04/faith-of-the-martian/</link><pubDate>Thu Feb 04 20:41:14 CST 2016</pubDate><title>The Faith of the Martian </title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>My first article for The Huffington Post went up this week:

But the subject matter is something I've been trying to find a way to talk about for a while now. I think we're experiencing a breakdown in how we approach religion, and I think that a lot of it has to do with how we think about faith. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the one hand, we have people who find it increasingly difficult to simply believe a list of facts. If Christianity is just about believing a set of facts without question, then it's going to be harder and harder for these people to consider themselves Christian, because, like it or not, everyone experiences doubt. I've known people to leave Christianity because they realized they could never fully abolish doubt — and they thought that's exactly what was being expected of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, we have people who have no trouble believing facts, but think that's the beginning and end of their faith. They end up disconnected from the world, living a life that doesn't resemble Jesus at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hope that we can begin to rethink our faith in light of the biblical story — and in that, find a vision that calls us forward to a better world, and a fuller embodiment of Christianity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/micah-redding/the-faith-of-the-martian_b_9128666.html"&gt;Read the article at the Huffington Post now&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/05/24/i-dont-speak-language/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/05/24/i-dont-speak-language/</link><pubDate>Thu May 24 19:02:00 CDT 2012</pubDate><title>I don't speak the language</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>I'm in the middle of a 40-day, 14-country tour of the world.

Our first two countries were Peru and Chilé. I do not speak Spanish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I like not speaking the language. I keep being told that I would enjoy it better if I spoke Spanish, and could converse more freely. But I don't think so. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One day I will speak Spanish and enjoy it. But for now, the conversations I do have are more intense, more profound, deeper - because there is no small talk, no small talk can be made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But more than that, I enjoy the company of people - the ones I pass on the street, the people at train terminals, riding next to me in silence, the co-pedestrians and fellow travelers. And I don't need language for that. Their warmth, the mass body heat that they collectively give off - is communication enough. And if we pass in silence with a stray friendly gesture, then I've entered their world as both an alien and a fellow human being. And I enjoy that. &lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2014/09/20/faq/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2014/09/20/faq/</link><pubDate>Sat Sep 20 20:10:51 CDT 2014</pubDate><title>FAQ</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>[What is Transhumanism?](http://micahredding.com/blog/2014/09/20/what-transhumanism)

This is distinct from pantheism, which sees the universe as equivalent to God.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Panentheism is an attempt to capture philosophically what the scriptures say about God's pervasive presence. &lt;a href="http://biblia.com/bible/esv/Ac17.28"&gt;Paul&lt;/a&gt; seems to express this idea: "For in him we live and move and have our being".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have usually understood this as saying that everything emerges from God, in a way similar to icebergs emerging from the ocean. However, this is only an analogy, and not a particularly great one. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, I have backed off on using the term &lt;em&gt;panentheism&lt;/em&gt; because it seems to be becoming associated with an impersonal God. Panentheism itself doesn't suggest an impersonal God, so this has been a surprise to me. But given that, it is perhaps not saying enough.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2008/12/05/interpreting-bible-start/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2008/12/05/interpreting-bible-start/</link><pubDate>Fri Dec 05 14:13:29 CST 2008</pubDate><title>Interpreting The Bible: A Start</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>If our task is discover the story which makes sense of all the Bible's complexity, we need an idea of where to start.

The Bible is complex, and understanding the big picture is hard. And as a result, many candidate stories are floating around. Many of them are stories I held to unquestioningly as I was reading the Bible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Bible exists to deliver morals, and to make us become moral"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Bible exists to teach us the correct things to believe"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Bible exists to deliver a pattern for the organization of a church"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Stories I've Heard&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem with all these stories is that they don't explain much. Why do we have such a complex set of books? Why not just a simple list of commands? Of course, the Bible describes such a list: the ten commandments. But it's obvious the Bible has a bigger purpose in mind, because it doesn't stop with the ten commandments, or even the details of where they came from, or even with explaining each of them and generating 613 sub-commandments. It just keeps going, and the rest of it stubbornly resists being condensed into commands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same is true with beliefs. The Bible is a staggeringly confusing document if you're trying to use it to understand what is truly necessary for a Christian to believe. It contains immense details about seemingly irrelevant issues, and scarce details about the things we usually want to know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And this is definitely the case with "church organization". Not only does the New Testament never mention such a thing, the effort required to extract instructions or even examples from the New Testament is astounding. If Jesus intended to establish a church along specific operating lines, couldn't he or one of his apostles have clearly laid out those guidelines, as God did for Moses? Why make it such a convoluted task to discover them?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We could go on - but if these stories don't really work, then where do we start?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Glimmering Of A Different Story&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In understanding the underlying story of the Bible, the story it goes to such lengths to expound to us, I start with the recognition that the Bible IS story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike almost every other religious document, the Bible consists almost entirely of different stories. This is amazing! And it's amazing how often this is overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we were studying the Koran, we'd need to have a story in mind to explain to us what we were reading, and what its purpose was. But the Bible makes us go a step further, and discover a story which will make sense of all the stories which compose it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This sounds confusing, but it tells me that the Bible is more concerned with Story itself than with commands, facts, or beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why? What it the significance of story?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Reason The Bible Is A Story&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bible is Story because Story is the only thing that changes people's lives. I mentioned earlier that Newton and Einstein were people with different stories of how the world works. The significance of the stories they told was enormous. Newton's story re-shaped the world, leading to massive re-structurings of society, the industrial revolution, the rise of deism and then secularism, and America as we know it. Einstein's story shook the foundations of the way people viewed the universe, and created most of the modern age as we see it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But those were rather simple stories, as stories go. Imagine a story similarly earth-shattering, and yet immensely deeper and more complex, a story whose depths could yield insight and human transformation for eons to come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Complex stories are more powerful than facts, because they contain the power to lead the hearers on a journey. That is precisely what film-makers, songwriters, and authors hope to accomplish. The best films and books and songs lead us through a path of understanding, deepening our insight at each step, until they resolve in a way that lets us go back into our lives with renewed understanding and perception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is what the Bible is: a complex story, written in human history, that draws us deeper and deeper in with each step. And in the final moments, it resolves in a way that points us to a new understanding of the world, a dynamic hope for the future, and the ever-present possibility of transformation.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2011/11/20/how-contact-me/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2011/11/20/how-contact-me/</link><pubDate>Sun Nov 20 08:42:14 CST 2011</pubDate><title>How to contact me</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>I care about my interactions with people more than almost anything else.

But I'm not very good at keeping up with all kinds of different communications technologies coming at me at the same time. As a result, there are some practices you need to know about. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For one, if you're calling, and I don't recognize the number, I'm not going to answer. If I don't know why you're calling, I'm probably not going to answer either. Too many people have consumed multiple hours of my time in phone conversation, when I just couldn't afford it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also don't do text messaging. Both my voicemail and my text messages go to my Google Voice, and I receive them as email. That's how I deal with them, so you might as well email me, and save a step.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But maybe you don't have access to email, but do have access to text messaging or a phone. That's fine, send me a message, and I'll respond when I can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So for my own sanity, and for yours, here's a short checklist:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Do you need to talk business with me?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Email. I've probably given you my email address already, and it's not that hard to find online. If you need something immediate from me, you should say so at the beginning or in the subject line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Do you need to setup a meeting?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Do you need to ask me for something?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Do you need to text me something?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Email. Or, if you have to, text my Google Voice number, and I'll get it as email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Do you need to call me?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Email. Or, if you have no other way to contact me, call my Google Voice number, and I'll get your transcribed message as an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Do you need to have a conversation with me about our personal relationship, or some dreamy idea-sharing, or just enjoying each other's company?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let's schedule coffee, or some one-on-one conversation time...via email.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2008/01/01/social-networks/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2008/01/01/social-networks/</link><pubDate>Tue Jan 01 18:37:00 CST 2008</pubDate><title>Social Networks</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>Connect with The Redding Brothers on any and all of these social networks:FacebookiLikeLast.fmMyspacePurevolumeFlickrYouTubeBeboVIRBimeemTwitter...</description><content:encoded>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Connect with The Redding Brothers on any and all of these social networks:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Redding-Brothers/8333326211"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://ilike.com/artist/reddingbrothers"&gt;iLike&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://last.fm/music/The+Redding+Brothers"&gt;Last.fm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://myspace.com/reddingbrothers"&gt;Myspace&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://purevolume.com/reddingbrothers"&gt;Purevolume&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://flickr.com/reddingbrothers"&gt;Flickr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://youtube.com/reddingbrothers"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bebo.com/reddingbrothers"&gt;Bebo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://virb.com/reddingbrothers"&gt;VIRB&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://imeem.com/reddingbrothers"&gt;imeem&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://twitter.com/reddingbrothers"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2010/07/28/twilight-and-the-burden-of-free-will/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2010/07/28/twilight-and-the-burden-of-free-will/</link><pubDate>Wed Jul 28 02:45:15 CDT 2010</pubDate><title>Twilight and the burden of free will</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>I watched the movie Eclipse recently.

I'm not a Twilight fan, but - well, we all have people in our lives, don't we?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One moment in particular stood out to me. In the middle of the one of the most intense scenes, Jacob angrily says that if Edward had stayed away for six more months, Bella would have forgotten about him, falling completely in love with Jacob.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twilight fans would no doubt argue the accuracy of that prediction, but I think it makes sense. I've seen many people (like Bella) in the middle of obsessive and unhealthy relationships, and without space to breath, they are never able to get enough separation to get a glimpse of the reality around them. They stay stuck in a world and a relationship collapsing in on itself, cutting off more and more people and possibilities as time goes on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But given enough separation, the fog of that relationship is able to clear, and they begin to see things more clearly. Unfortunately, that's rarely given the chance to happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the movie, Bella's friends and family feel her pulling away from them, sinking into the darkness of obsession - and they try to get her to get some space. But Bella can't and won't. She knows what she wants, and she won't stop to consider any other possibilities. And so everyone - to varying degrees - loses her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what about those six months?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If things had turned out different, if she had been given another six months of separation from Edward, she might have begun to see things differently. Jacob, the character embodying light and life, would have probably finally drawn her attention, and her life would have veered in a very different direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Down one path, she ended up giving up most of her relationships, and even her very life, to pursue this ever-deepening obsession with Edward. Down the other path, she could have resurfaced in a vibrant relationship with Jacob that would draw her friends and family more fully into her life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the only difference was six months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I saw this played out in the movie, it struck me how much our decisions really &lt;em&gt;matter&lt;/em&gt;. The things we say and do today have consequences and effects that spiral outward from us, toppling things we cherish, building up things we never expected. Marriage, divorce, life and death, obsession and distance, each are ultimately determined on tiny decisions and small moments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is frightening, but right now, you have the power to radically change the next 80 years of someone's life. And you don't even know how to control this power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don't be scared. But think. And think hard.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2008/09/29/a-christian-band-embedding-christianity-in-life/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2008/09/29/a-christian-band-embedding-christianity-in-life/</link><pubDate>Mon Sep 29 12:43:00 CDT 2008</pubDate><title>A Christian Band? - embedding Christianity in life</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description> This is from my personal adventure blog.

It deals with an alternate approach to how Christianity plays in public today. I call that approach embedded Christianity.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This weekend I was asked for the thousandth time if my band is a “Christian band”.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s a tricky question - with many ramifications on either side.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If I say, “Yes, we are a Christian band”, then I pigeon-hole us in a way I don’t want to be pigeon-holed. In many people’s minds, at least, this would mean that we only play songs that directly talk about a spiritual or religious subject. To most people, it would mean we were playing “Contemporary Christian Music”, a genre that has less to do with Christian subject matter than with a particular sound that has broad appeal among the Christian market.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Neither of those things are true about us. We do not play CCM (Contemporary Christian Music), nor do I limit my songs to ones that have religious themes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My approach to music is from a different direction altogether. Rather than set out a genre that I want my music to fall into, I set out from the start to write music about things I &lt;em&gt;cared about&lt;/em&gt;. The things I think about and immerse myself in become the subjects and the inspiration for the songs I write.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rather than set out to write a song about the theological notion of God’s grace, I write a song that arises suddenly and spontaneously from my experience of the utter depth of my &lt;a title="Unfaithful" href="http://www.reddingbrothers.com/music"&gt;faithlessness&lt;/a&gt; - and the recognition of God’s presence even there.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;How could I say we’re a Christian band? But how could I say we’re not?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The issue is that we’ve divided the world up into the “Christian market” and the “secular market”, into “the Christian subculture” and everything else. We have Christian movies, Christian music, Christian comedians, Christian television, Christian books, Christian bookstores, Christian colleges, etc, etc, etc.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I don’t think Jesus intended things to be done this way. Jesus didn’t intend to set up a subculture - an insular group creating content only for themselves. Instead, he intended to create a group that would go out into the world and draw from his example to &lt;em&gt;create&lt;/em&gt;, to transform the situations they found themselves in.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rather than Christian movies, we should have Christians &lt;em&gt;embedded&lt;/em&gt; in Hollywood, involved in the making of movies, influencing them to be deeper, more artistic, more authentic. Rather than Christian musicians, we should have Christians involved in the creation of music at all levels, &lt;em&gt;embedded&lt;/em&gt; in the music culture, authentically expressing the human spirit.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If we shift from the idea of a Christian subculture to this idea of embedded Christianity, we will see something far more productive than simply an alternate version of whatever’s popular in secular culture. Instead, we will see the rise of an entirely new level of cultural and creative development, as Christians everywhere begin to use their God-given creativity to transform &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of their lives.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If we shift to this idea of embedded Christianity, we won’t just see more songs written to be sung on Sunday mornings, we’ll see songs written to cruise to, to climb mountains with, to sing to your friends and neighbors. We’ll see music that addresses all of our God-given human emotions, that honors the depths of humanity created in the image of God.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And bearing the image of God in all that you do is definitely not a narrow genre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;        &lt;/div&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/01/31/vast-economy/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/01/31/vast-economy/</link><pubDate>Tue Jan 31 11:09:06 CST 2012</pubDate><title>The Vast Economy</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>Increasingly, I have come to believe that the world is best understood as a Vast Economy, an ecosystem encompassing all the small economies we know about and measure, utilizing our every choice, from ...</description><content:encoded>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Increasingly, I have come to believe that the world is best understood as a Vast Economy, an ecosystem encompassing all the small economies we know about and measure, utilizing our every choice, from the individual to the society at large, for its own ends and purposes. In this Economy, nothing is ever wasted, nothing is lost, and everything follows a brilliant and sinister logic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within this Economy, we may see different rings of sub-economies, different systems operating under specific rulesets and premises. These are the typical focus of human study, but they are simply small parts of the overall system, maintaining boundaries that are determined largely by dark forces looming outside their perimeters. From within a given economy, it may be nearly impossible to perceive that there is a boundary, that there is something on the other side, and that the known order of things is held in sway to forces both deeper and more absolute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is the rise and fall of these many sub-systems that is the business of the Vast Economy. Its own outer perimeters are the energy intake of the earth itself, at approximately 3,850,000 exajoules per year, and the energy which leaves as radiant heat. Everything in between belongs to the Economy, from the movements of tectonic plates to the fluctuations in the crime rate of Indonesia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The economy as we normally consider it is the narrow band of human activity that involves the exchange of measured units of value within the structures and systems of approved, legal processes. But this economy exists only at the mercy of the larger world, a world which has given it leeway and protected it from outside incursions. The black market is not the exception to the legal economy, it is the more fundamental force which has given space for the legal economy to come into being. And the black market itself is only one band of activity within the much larger circles of energetic, psychological, and information exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My interest is in the big picture of what exactly the Vast Economy is trying to optimize, and the particular role of human violence within that scheme. What makes this economy &lt;em&gt;Vast&lt;/em&gt; is that there is nothing that ultimately works against it - our small economies must resist and react to forces which breach their boundaries, but from the overall perspective, these many sub-economies and their collisions are simply different ways of reaching the Vast Economy's ends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I suspect that one thing being optimized is the increase of cooperation, or conversely, the reduction of violence. Cooperation is the glue that has allowed complex systems of all kinds to form, from multi-cellular creatures to stock exchanges to the Autobahn. There is no end-point to this optimization - each additional layer of cooperation allows a new type of violence to emerge, providing the staging ground for the increase of a new level of cooperation and complexity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if cooperation is the ends, the means are many and varied. Human violence, in particular, has been in rapid decline for thousands of years; but the things that have reduced this violence are sometimes perplexing and counter-intuitive. Where there are mafia, mafia bosses will arise, reducing the overall incidence of violence, improving the efficiency of the operation. Where there is civil war, dictators will brutally dominate the people, expunging social unrest through their own killing programs. Tribal hierarchies, scapegoating rituals, the divine right of kings, total war - these are all answers the Economy has provided to problem of violence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, the reduction of violence needn't be so bloody. Where society has chosen to practice compassion on a large scale, such measures are avoided. Gift economies, the rise of democracy, the free market - these are also answers the Economy has provided.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But don't make the mistake of thinking that the Economy has &lt;em&gt;our&lt;/em&gt; best interests at heart. The brutal truth is that it will quite happily plow us under on the way forward. Becoming a mob boss might defuse violence today, but killing a mob boss might be the answer tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conclusion is that the Economy will achieve its ends no matter what. We may choose to instigate killing programs, or we may choose to start orphanages, but the Economy does not care. It will use both choices to move towards its own goals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The purpose of writing this is not to address such choices. It is instead to suggest looking at things with new eyes. Everything we see, from the flow of traffic in the city, to the migration patterns of Florida retirees, to the political intrigue playing out on an international scale - is simply a mechanism in the overall scheme of the world. And everything we do, from the way we sip our coffee in the morning, to the career choice we agonize over - is simply another move in the game being played by The Vast Economy.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2005/08/26/things/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2005/08/26/things/</link><pubDate>Fri Aug 26 13:05:00 CDT 2005</pubDate><title>Things...</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>Things have been taking off recently...did the show in Dickson, got the talent showcase at House Blend in Columbia, got the Rocketown show.

It was used to burn up trash and refuse. Jesus uses the metaphor of Gehenna to talk about the horrible consequences that were coming upon some of his Jewish countrymen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Matthew 10:28&lt;br/&gt;"Do not fear those who kill the body but are unable to kill the soul; but rather fear Him who is able to destroy both soul and body in GEHENNA."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only thing we're told here about Gehenna is that it is a place of destruction. Not eternal torment, not torture, but destruction. And destruction means that something is gone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Worms and Fire&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mark 9:47-49&lt;br/&gt;47 "If your eye causes you to stumble, throw it out; it is better for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye, than, having two eyes, to be cast into GEHENNA, 48 where THEIR WORM DOES NOT DIE, AND THE FIRE IS NOT QUENCHED. 49 "For everyone will be salted with fire. 50 "Salt is good; but if he salt becomes unsalty, with what will you make it salty again? Have salt in yourselves, and be at peace with one another."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we see Gehenna again. This time, we see a mention of worms and fire. Some people take this to mean torment of some kind. But Jesus wasn't speaking off the cuff. He was quoting Isaiah:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Isaiah 66:24&lt;br/&gt;"Then they will go forth and look On the corpses of the men Who have transgressed against Me. For their worm will not die And their fire will not be quenched; And they will be an abhorrence to all mankind."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here Isaiah refers to a time when God has killed his enemies, and the righteous come up to worship him. And what do the righteous see? The CORPSES of the wicked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not people being tortured. Not people still conscious. Instead, they see dead corpses being eaten by worms, and consumed in fire. The point here is that their defeat is so total, these dead corpses are going to rot forever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notice what is eternal in this passage: the worms and the flame. God's tools of destruction are eternal, their work is final, and his enemies are gone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When God gets done with his enemies, there's nothing left.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE LAKE OF FIRE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Revelation 19:20-21&lt;br/&gt;"20 And the beast was seized, and with him the false prophet who performed the signs in his presence, by which he deceived those who had received the mark of the beast and those who worshiped his image; these two were thrown alive into the lake of fire which burns with brimstone. 21 And the rest were killed with the sword which came from the mouth of Him who sat on the horse, and all the birds were filled with their flesh."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is the bible's main mention of a "Lake of Fire". I don't know about you, but when I think of things being thrown into a lake of fire, I immediately think of things being burnt up. I don't picture those people somehow miraculously surviving to swim around in constant torture. No, they are instantly destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This reminds me of Gehenna, the burning rubbish pit outside of Jerusalem, used (according to Jesus) to burn up the corpses of God's enemies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Revelation 20:13-14a&lt;br/&gt;13 And the sea gave up the dead which were in it, and death and Hades gave up the dead which were in them; and they were judged, every one of them according to their deeds. 14a Then death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we have the judgment, and then the destruction of Hades (the waiting place) along with those not in the book of life. With the destruction of Hades, there is no more waiting. And just as Hades has been destroyed, so will those people who are not in the book of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fate of the evil and the fate of Hades are exactly the same: irreversible destruction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Revelation 20:14b-15&lt;br/&gt;14b This is the second death, the lake of fire. 15 And if anyone's name was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And here we have the one and only biblical definition of the "Lake of Fire": SECOND DEATH. What the first death couldn't do (destroy people totally), the second death will do fully. Just like Jesus said:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Matthew 10:28&lt;br/&gt;"Do not fear those who kill the body but are unable to kill the soul; but rather fear Him who is able to destroy both soul and body in GEHENNA."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Second Death can only be administered by God, and this death is final.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Revelation 21:8&lt;br/&gt;"But for the cowardly and unbelieving and abominable and murderers and immoral persons and sorcerers and idolaters and all liars, their part will be in the lake that burns with fire and brimstone, which is the second death."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, we are told that the lake of fire is the second (and final) death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ETERNAL PUNISHMENT and ETERNAL DEATH&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paul doesn't talk much about the eternal fate of the wicked in the terms we've seen. He doesn't use terms like "Gehenna" or "Lake of Fire". Whereas Jesus and Revelation use a lot of poetic and dramatic language to get their point across, Paul is somewhat more direct. For him, the truth is simple:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Romans 6:23&lt;br/&gt;23 For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The line is clearly drawn. God gives eternal life, not eternal torment. The wages of sin isn't eternal torment, it's death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;2Thessalonians 1:8-9&lt;br/&gt;8 dealing out retribution to those who do not know God and to those who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus. 9 These will pay the penalty of eternal destruction, away from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of His power&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, Paul identifies the penalty of disobedience to God to be death. "Destruction" is the word he uses here, and destruction doesn't mean hanging around forever! He uses the adjective "eternal" to indicate just how complete this destruction is - it's destruction that cannot be recovered from. It's permanent destruction. It's eternal destruction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A couple of other terms like this are used. Jesus used the term "eternal punishment" once:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Matthew 25:45-46&lt;br/&gt;45 "Then He will answer them, `Truly I say to you, to the extent that you did not do it to one of the least of these, you did not do it to Me.' 46 "These will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Somehow people look at these terms and read "eternal conscious torment" into them. Eternal punishment is just punishment that lasts forever - that is final and irrevocable. The punishment is death, and the death is eternal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE LANGUAGE OF ETERNITY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One common notion (that's very hard to shake) is that "eternal" means "ongoing, or continually repeating". So we read the phrase "eternal punishment" to mean "ongoing, ever-repeating punishment".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when looking at the Bible, we have to deal with the fact that we're not the original audience. We experience its words in a much different way than they did; we have 2000 years of church history behind us. So it is extremely useful to understand how the Biblical authors used the word "eternal".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mark 3:29 But whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven; he is guilty of an eternal sin.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does a blasphemer continually repeat the sin for all eternity? Or do the RESULTS of the sin extend forever?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eph 3:10-11 His intent was that now, through the church, the manifold wisdom of God should be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly realms, 11 according to his eternal purpose which he accomplished in Christ Jesus our Lord.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ETERNAL PURPOSE is something that was accomplished once for all, not something that continues to be done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hebrews 5:8-9&lt;br/&gt;8 Although he was a son, he learned obedience from what he suffered 9 and, once made perfect, he became the source of eternal salvation for all who obey him.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Salvation means to "get rescued from something". Does the salvation occur once for all, with effects lasting forever, or does Jesus continue to rescue us over and over throughout all eternity?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hebrews 6:2&lt;br/&gt;2 instruction about baptisms, the laying on of hands, the resurrection of the dead, and eternal judgment.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The judgment happens once and is done; the results last forever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hebrews 9:12&lt;br/&gt;12 He did not enter by means of the blood of goats and calves; but he entered the Most Holy Place once for all by his own blood, having obtained eternal redemption.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The redemption happened ONCE, but it is eternal redemption because its effects last forever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The above represents the &lt;em&gt;natural&lt;/em&gt; way the bible uses these kind of terms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-Some people receive eternal redemption&lt;br/&gt;-Others commit eternal sins&lt;br/&gt;-and are brought under eternal judgment,&lt;br/&gt;-after which, they receive eternal punishment&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nothing in that list makes sense if "eternal" is taken to mean "continuously repeated". But they make all the sense in the world if "eternal" means "the effects last forever".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We've looked at a bunch of words and phrases: Gehenna, Lake of Fire, Eternal Punishment. And you've hopefully noticed that the idea of eternal conscious torment is conspicuously absent. The sole idea of all of these terms that is there is destruction, death, or annihilation for the wicked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, I want to look at something that doesn't really fit with either the waiting we've talked about, or the destruction we've covered.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/the-serpents-lie/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/the-serpents-lie/</link><pubDate>Fri Apr 28 16:45:10 CDT 2017</pubDate><title>The Serpent’s Lie</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>I’ve heard it over and over again, when people are considering some new capabilities or technological power:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is just a repeat of the Serpent’s lie, &lt;em&gt;You shall be like God!&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reference is to Genesis, where the Serpent tempts Eve by promising her that the forbidden fruit will make her like God. Eve believes the lie, eats the fruit, and there goes the future of the human race.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s just one problem. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;That’s not what the Bible says. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biblically speaking, all the people who have made the above statement about the “Serpent’s lie” were actually calling God a liar. Because &lt;a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+3:22&amp;version=NIV"&gt;just a few verses later&lt;/a&gt;, God himself confirms the Serpent’s claim that Eve had become &lt;em&gt;like God&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, the Bible makes it clear that God’s whole intention for the human race was that they be &lt;em&gt;like God&lt;/em&gt;. The &lt;a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=genesis+1:26-27&amp;version=NIV"&gt;very first thing&lt;/a&gt; that the Bible says about humans is that this is what God created them for. &lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/the-tree-of-the-knowledge-of-good-and-evil"&gt;As I’ve described elsewhere&lt;/a&gt;, this is why God plants the two trees in the Garden of Eden—both of which would make humanity more like God.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New Testament takes this farther, describing Christianity as the call to be like Christ, the human being who is perfectly “like God”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Biblical claim is that humanity was made to be like God, that humanity is already somewhat like God, and that humanity is intended to become more like God through the imitation of Christ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, the Serpent &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; tell a lie—It’s just not about being like God. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The serpent said to the woman, “You shall not surely die.” (Genesis 3:4)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Serpent was right that humanity was made to be like God, and would become more like God through eating of the Tree of Knowledge. The Serpent was lying when it claimed that this expanded set of capabilities was free of risks and responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The biblical story insists that expanded, God-like knowledge carried with it &lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/the-dark-side-of-knowledge"&gt;an incredible set of risks&lt;/a&gt;, and that refusing to face these risks has led to devastating consequences throughout the checkered history of the human race. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is why salvation comes through Christ, the human who &lt;em&gt;does surely die&lt;/em&gt;, facing all of these risks and responsibilities, and taking their consequences on himself. And this is why we are called to imitate him. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Serpent’s lie was that we could take on God-like power, without taking on God-like responsibility. This is why Eve was deceived. She wanted to be like God in one area, and shrink from being like God in another. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The truth is that Eve needed to become more like God than she ever imagined. Because there is nothing more God-like than accepting and acknowledging your power, while being willing to bear the responsibilities that come with it. &lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/what-is-happening-in-the-world/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/what-is-happening-in-the-world/</link><pubDate>Wed Feb 01 08:40:01 CST 2017</pubDate><title>What is Happening in the World?</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>Here is what I believe is happening in the world.

The necessity of extreme poverty is vanishing in the rear view mirror, the incidence of global violence is declining precipitously. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But like bookstore chains disappearing with the rise of digital literature, progress often unleashes chaos. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After all, prosperity drives—and is driven by—rapid disruptive change. It disrupts the ways communities function, it changes the ways societies operate, it distributes resources differently, it creates new questions, and poses new challenges. It forces us to ask what we care about, and provokes us to wonder what is worth fighting for. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And in human societies, it radically empowers extremisms of all kinds—from ISIS to white supremacy. Mainstream visions cannot keep up with the anxiety and fear unleashed by rapid change, nor can they offer a challenge compelling enough to help us overcome it. And so the most extreme visions available begin to seem compelling, and rush in to fill center stage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This starts at the edges and works its way in—until even middle American teenagers are abandoning the mall, and joining terrorist organizations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, extremism fuels extremism. And so terror from all sides begins to escalate. Fear empowers violence, which inspires fear, which empowers violence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There will be no end to this until we have blown ourselves up, or reached a new equilibrium in a world with more potential and technological capability than we have ever seen before. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means that we are now in an arms-race between fear and hope. Fear inspiring violence on the one hand, and hope empowering compassion on the other. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If fear wins, we will become radicalized ourselves, and burn our world to the ground. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if hope prevails, we will stare overwhelming fear in the face, and choose to be compassionate anyway. And then, we will discover that we have won. &lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2007/01/03/rock-roll-can-save-the-worldfrom-rb/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2007/01/03/rock-roll-can-save-the-worldfrom-rb/</link><pubDate>Wed Jan 03 09:51:00 CST 2007</pubDate><title>Rock &amp; Roll Can Save The World...from R&amp;B</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>In the beginning, when black people created music, all was good and right in the world.And the people separated music  into two forms: Rock &amp;amp; Roll, and R &amp;amp; B.Each of these forms of music would...</description><content:encoded>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;In the beginning, when black people created music, all was good and right in the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the people separated music into two forms: Rock &amp;amp; Roll, and R &amp;amp; B.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each of these forms of music would be a different approach, a different path.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of these paths would lead to all that is good and right in music: Elvis Presley, the Beatles, Jimi Hendrix, and finally, &lt;a href="http://www.reddingbrothers.com/"&gt;the Redding Brothers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other path would lead to all that is wrong with music: Nelly, Ludacris, Snoop Dogg, and Flava Flav.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Evil Path was not content with simply co-existing. Instead, it wanted everything it could grasp. And so it took the radio, the airwaves, the pop charts, and finally Rob Thomas; all of them fell under its trance. And then it turned and co-opted the glory of the Good Path, sampling and perverting the truly good songs into sappy, brutish forms of noise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pop stars were the first to go: Justin Timberlake, Christina Aguilera, the resurrected Backstreet Boys. Those who would not convert were simply brushed aside. But eventually the sheer power involved would sway even the most classic rock stars, and divert their energies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What can save us from this malady that has overtaken the world?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only a return to Rock &amp;amp; Roll, a recapturing of the original spirit of independence and expression, can wake the world from the stupor thrown on it by the plague of R&amp;amp;B.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This answer cannot come from the record companies. It cannot come from Hollywood. It must come from someone outside the system, someone who can dig deeply and recapture that original spirit. Only someone who has truly tasted the freedom of Rock &amp;amp; Roll has this power to change the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who is that someone?&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/04/03/why-i-am-speaking-mormon-transhumanist-conference/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/04/03/why-i-am-speaking-mormon-transhumanist-conference/</link><pubDate>Tue Apr 03 09:40:40 CDT 2012</pubDate><title>Why I am speaking at the Mormon Transhumanist Conference</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>Late last year, I [explained](http://micahredding.com/blog/2011/09/21/why-i-joined-mormon-trashumanist-association) why I (a non-Mormon) had joined the Mormon Transhumanist Association.

I felt like religious people hadn't been interfacing with the future to any appreciable degree, and that those who were spiritual and religious needed to speak out on the issues that rapid change and technological acceleration are causing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This weekend, I'll be speaking at the &lt;a href="http://transfigurism-2012.eventbrite.com/"&gt;Mormon Transhumanist Association Conference&lt;/a&gt;, trying to take up my own commission, talking about what it means to be human in the Jewish and Christian narrative, and what that entails for ourselves and our future. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Identity&lt;/em&gt;, after all, is where it always starts. Identity was the battleground between &lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/03/12/ancient-israel-vs-blood-gods"&gt;ancient Judaism&lt;/a&gt; and the blood-gods, and between Christianity and &lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/04/02/jesus-insurgent"&gt;imperial paganism&lt;/a&gt;. And identity will increasingly mark the battle-lines around which our culture will fracture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's more important than ever that we have these discussions. If you can be involved in something in your area, do it. If you can get to Salt Lake City, &lt;a href="http://transfigurism-2012.eventbrite.com/"&gt;join me&lt;/a&gt;.

The first one is control—the ability to constrain action. The second one is freedom—the ability to act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These two kinds of power are in deep conflict, locked together in an inverse relationship. The more control, the less freedom—the more freedom, the less control. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is because in seeking to control others, you must first control yourself. You cannot control the outside without first engaging in a battle for control inside—and an internal battle for control has many causalities. The prisoners of that war are not quiet, and not peaceful, and you must be on constant guard duty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Control can only limit, not compel. It can make sure someone has no escape, but it cannot make someone move forward. It can make sure someone doesn’t run away, but it cannot make someone produce an original idea. It can make someone stay, but it cannot make someone love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same is true of internal control. Willpower can prevent you from eating ice cream, but it cannot make you create a work of art.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can probably think of counter-examples, but in those cases, you chose to act, to do something great, to move forward. No one and nothing could have compelled you, though they could have presented consequences too deep for you to want anything else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, you had to find the &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; somewhere else. Even if your willpower was trying to control your hands, you had to find the drive to act in some other part of your mind. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My hypothesis is that the more willpower you use—the more control you seek over your internal workings—the less freedom to act you actually possess. The long-term use of willpower slowly strangles and kills off the freedom and ability to create.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which isn’t to say &lt;em&gt;do nothing&lt;/em&gt;. Quite the opposite. But looking for willpower and control to make you produce great work is looking to the wrong slave-master. It is seeking the wrong sort of power. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/two-kinds-of-power"&gt;Fascists can’t make art. But they’re killer at design.&lt;/a&gt;{: .tweet-this}&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is because art is creative work, while design is the application of rules. Fascists design everything from flags to uniforms to &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest_swastika"&gt;forests&lt;/a&gt;, while freer places struggle with unruly mixed genres and mediums. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to produce something great, you must be &lt;em&gt;drawn&lt;/em&gt;, pulled forward by something which compels of its own accord. And in that case, you will find yourself drawn towards freedom &lt;em&gt;by&lt;/em&gt; freedom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The freedom to act is also the freedom to live. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Holocaust survivors like &lt;a href="http://amzn.to/2hdAcOP"&gt;Victor Frankl&lt;/a&gt; seemed to find incredible and unexpected ways to take action, even in the midst of unbelievable control. Even if the action was only in their mind, it was a surprising action, one neither defined nor anticipated by their environment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jesus advised his followers to do something similar. His instructions are often misread as directions towards passivity; in reality, they are anything but. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a Roman soldier conscripts you into carrying his bags, don’t let him define the situation. Instead, when you come to the end of the road, keep going. Carry his bag the &lt;em&gt;extra mile&lt;/em&gt;. Don’t let his power have the last word—instead, change the situation with &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or, if someone sues you for the shirt off your back, go ahead and give him the rest of your clothes as well. Strip naked in court, hand him your underwear, and walk out as the court watches in shocked silence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That last instruction doesn’t get quoted as much, but it captures the spirit of Jesus’ sayings perfectly. When they bring control, you bring playfulness and creativity; when they exert power, you redefine the situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of fighting for control, you fight for possibility. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That might be one of the reasons Jesus is so frequently portrayed as a baby—babies embody possibility. If you recall the &lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/12/25/christmas"&gt;Christmas story&lt;/a&gt;, you’ll remember it as an almost absurd showdown between the power of imagination and possibility that keeps taking hold in songs, and shepherds, and foreign travelers (as they encounter &lt;em&gt;a baby in a barn&lt;/em&gt;) and the power of control forcefully asserted in palaces and decrees by the violent kings of the land. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are two kinds of power in the world, and if the story of Jesus tells us anything, it’s that the power of creative freedom always wins.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2004/12/14/weekend-in-cincinnati/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2004/12/14/weekend-in-cincinnati/</link><pubDate>Tue Dec 14 03:02:00 CST 2004</pubDate><title>Weekend in Cincinnati</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>So, we spent the weekend in Cincinnati performing.

Siah even rescheduled his ACT to take place in Cincinnati so we could pull it off. Chalk it up to another crazy thing we've done.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, it was great. We played at Everybody's Records on Saturday, and they were really nice. And it's always great to be playing surrounded by vinyl. Our cousins surprised us by showing up, so we spent some time with them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This weekend, we're heading to Hillsboro and Columbus. We're busy building a trailer to hold all the stuff we'll need this weekend, as well as making more tshirts and all kinds of junk, er, I mean, merchandise. :) So besides working ourselves to death trying to get everything done, we're having a lot of fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Muffins with cream cheese are surprisingly good.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-micah&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2013/10/29/three-strains-religious-transhumanism/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2013/10/29/three-strains-religious-transhumanism/</link><pubDate>Tue Oct 29 17:52:57 CDT 2013</pubDate><title>Three strains of religious transhumanism</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>I think that there are three strains of religious and spiritual transhumanism.

This definitely &lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/04/25/christianity-transhumanism"&gt;applies to me&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second one seeks to grapple with metaphysics and cosmology, and in discovering transhumanism, finds a new and vibrant way to engage with the deepest of philosophical and spiritual problems. This &lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/09/12/some-simulation-argument-flowcharts"&gt;applies to me&lt;/a&gt; as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The third one finds it difficult to believe the traditional claims of religion. But rather than abandoning those claims, it finds in them a plan for action. If the sick are not healed, we will work to heal the sick. If the dead are not raised, we will work to raise the dead. If the kingdom is not coming, we will work to bring the kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my darker moments, when I suspect that all of my thought and reason and philosophy is mistaken — worse, that rationality itself is a sort of delusion — this last thought is what holds me together. Beyond modernism and postmodernism and epistemology upon epistemology, &lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/03/05/arguing-about-bible"&gt;there is action&lt;/a&gt;, and action is the ultimate meaning of &lt;em&gt;faith&lt;/em&gt; — the daring commitment to step out into the nothingness and begin to build.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regardless of which strain you may lean towards, they are all necessary, needed, valuable, and welcome.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2011/10/18/beginning-thought/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2011/10/18/beginning-thought/</link><pubDate>Tue Oct 18 12:10:05 CDT 2011</pubDate><title>The beginning of thought</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>This is an ever-changing launching point for various ideas I'm working on.

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The universe bends towards order and complexity. Far from being opposed to the laws of thermodynamics (entropy), this move is actually fueled by entropy. So everything in the universe is always moving in the direction of greater information content, greater order, greater complexity, greater cooperation. Entropy only dictates despair if the information content of the universe is finite. Otherwise, it dictates hope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The way this plays out in our world can be characterized as &lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/01/31/vast-economy"&gt;The Vast Economy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can derive most of the things we would identify as positive human qualities (cooperation, lack of violence, intelligence, creativity, altruism, equality) from the overall slant of the universe towards complexity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea that the universe "bends towards justice" can be derived from the above. This leads one to a &lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/2011/10/05/believe-or-dont-believe"&gt;theistic conception&lt;/a&gt; of reality. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;"Justice" is an emergent property of the move towards greater complexity and cooperation, and results in the periodic overturning of society, as the powerful from the previous cycle get churned under in favor of a new kind of powerful.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Living in the "curve" of this turnover is troubling and dynamic and liberating. It's where humans have found themselves during great moments in history.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Most of religion should be read as the struggle to understand and deal with life on the curve.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We need to work on an explanation of the precise linkup between &lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/2011/10/10/thoughts-science-and-religion"&gt;science and religion&lt;/a&gt;. Most of the conflict comes from different ways of speaking. Religion should be understood as a set of hypotheses (properly translated), and a set of values, and a set of ways of understanding and practicing the relation between the two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of what religion says is not intended to be taken as statements about physical reality. "Soul", for example, is not a hypotheses about the nature of the mind-body connection. "Justice", however, can be taken as a hypothesis, given the framework I laid out above.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Christianity was originally the &lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/2011/10/02/christianity-against-religion"&gt;rejection of religion&lt;/a&gt; in favor of internal motivation towards objective values. This message came into being in the midst of a nation's struggle for identity, and an impending conflict with the world power of the time. Christianity posited a particular application of its ideas to this political situation, and this is what most of the New Testament is about.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Several main motifs in early christianity:&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The overcoming of racial division&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The equality of the rich and poor&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The equal participation of men and women&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The rejection of rituals and places of worship&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Love instead of violence, sacrifice overcoming power&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paul &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/2011/10/03/paul"&gt;got it&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Paul has been misunderstood on the subject of social divisions.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Paul was working on overcoming any such divisions, and helping people deal with the clash of ethnicities and genders and social classes that ensued.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;This is the subject of most of Paul's letters.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Paul was a pacifist, and like most other pacifists, gets called a coward.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Paul was against slavery, but was a pacifist. So many people think he was for slavery.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Paul was for equal participation of women. But he got involved in several interesting discussions that have been misconstrued:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/2011/10/30/how-1-corinthians-11-actually-statement-about-female-equality"&gt;1 Cor 11&lt;/a&gt;, Paul suggests women don't need to "burn their bras" to demonstrate equality.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;1 Cor 14, Paul suggests wives and husbands don't argue in public, but take their fights home.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/03/06/death-and-knowledge-good-and-evil/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/03/06/death-and-knowledge-good-and-evil/</link><pubDate>Tue Mar 06 11:26:53 CST 2012</pubDate><title>Death and The Knowledge of Good and Evil</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>Let's talk about Adam and Eve and the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil.

God had warned Adam and Eve that in taking the knowledge, they would die. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the story seems to be telling us something different. When Adam and Eve take the knowledge, they don't immediately die. Instead, they experience immense shame, and a breakdown of their relationship with each other and with the natural world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So the warning was not about immediate physical death. Some suggest it was about a "spiritual death", but if we stop there, that seems to stray from the immediate subject matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story is about &lt;em&gt;knowledge&lt;/em&gt;. About knowing things that only God is supposed to know, things that bring fear and terror into the human heart. That knowledge takes hold and becomes a defining force in history, corrupting all of human existence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So the story is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; about how we lost our immortality. The story is about how we discovered the secret the animal kingdom does not know: We all die.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/11/21/1353537350/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/11/21/1353537350/</link><pubDate>Wed Nov 21 16:35:50 CST 2012</pubDate><title>1353537350</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>My Mormon friends say that religion is an expression of our aspiration.

Our belief that God is love is indistinguishable from our desire to be love ourselves. Our belief that God is holy is indistinguishable from our desire to be pure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As such, I don't think religion serves the need of security, as much as it gives us hope, and something to aim for, and something to be ambitious about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which, to me, sounds a lot like what the OT prophets were concerned about. They didn't like people worshipping idols, because you become what you worship. Instead, they held up a narrative in which God is explicitly a being we are modelled after and are intended to model ourselves after (the point of Genesis 1). And this God is creative and loving and humane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/355412356848/permalink/10151187135516849/?comment_id=10151188240246849&amp;offset=0&amp;total_comments=21"&gt;https://www.facebook.com/groups/355412356848/permalink/10151187135516849/?comment_id=10151188240246849&amp;offset=0&amp;total_comments=21&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2005/01/15/open-mic-night-conclusion/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2005/01/15/open-mic-night-conclusion/</link><pubDate>Sat Jan 15 18:34:00 CST 2005</pubDate><title>Open Mic Night Conclusion</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>The Open Mic Night went great!

Thi...</description><content:encoded>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Life is a series of pains. We don’t get to choose a pain-free life, but over time, we do get to choose to live with more interesting pains, like the pain of problem-solving, or creation, or love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a fundamental fact of any existence worth having.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;God is thought of primarily as “creator”. In the Jewish and Christian traditions, he is the being who generates new things from the darkness, and calls into being that which is not. So when the bible tells us that we are made in the image of God, we are meant to understand that we too have the ability to create things which were never imagined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Hell” in the Christian scriptures is not a place, but an event. That event is the moment when reality catches up with you, and confronts you with the raw truth. When that happens to societies, they burn to the ground. When it happens to individuals, they are undone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the intensity of that flame is voluntary. You can choose to let it engulf you like a purifying burn, or choose to resist it until it consumes you like a furnace. The longer you resist, the more intense is your undoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The entertainment industry has seen this all too well. Music and book publishers set out to resist change, and to work against the clear call of the future. They burn as we speak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But other people saw the coming changes, and leaned into them. They prospered even as their industries failed. They took the difficult path of letting go of the past, experiencing the loss, and then claiming what the future had to offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Christians of the first century knew that the world around them was about to be overturned. Instead of resisting that, they chose to live into the world that was coming, and so found themselves living as foreigners in the world they were from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when the changes came, everyone else quaked in terror. Empires were rocked. Nations fell. Whole ways of being disappeared from the earth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the Christians walked forward and claimed the new earth that arose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are on an upward and outward path. We confront more interesting pains and dilemmas as we go. Overcoming a problem leads to momentary relief, while success leads to new complications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This, however, is not torture. This is reward - the reward of growing and struggling and rising. It is our birthright as human beings, and our guarantee from God. The path does not stop. We may always rise.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2006/12/02/the-second-album-part-3-progress/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2006/12/02/the-second-album-part-3-progress/</link><pubDate>Sat Dec 02 00:20:00 CST 2006</pubDate><title>The Second Album, Part 3: Progress</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>We took the whole weekend and used our time to lay down tracks for 8 songs that will be appearing on our upcoming release, but for the songs we were working with, we decided to use our in-home studio ...</description><content:encoded>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;We took the whole weekend and used our time to lay down tracks for 8 songs that will be appearing on our upcoming release, but for the songs we were working with, we decided to use our in-home studio for convenience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, Gabe and I worked for most of the day recording bass tracks. This is not something that would have normally taken most of the day, but we ended up recording all of the tracks twice, because the first time, they somehow mysteriously disappeared from our hard drive. When we couldn’t find the first takes, we panicked and called Apple Logic Pro Technical Support (for the software we use for recording) and spent another hour talking to them about it trying to see if they might be stored somewhere we weren’t aware of, before coming to the conclusion that we truly did lose everything and would have to do it all over again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So after doing the bass tracks for a second time, we scheduled out the rest of the evening for vocals. Living in a flat in downtown Antioch (a suburb of Nashville), we knew we only had until 9:00 p.m. to finish all of our recording for the day, because of the “quiet time” rules in our community. We’d already had a complaint filed against us for Gabe playing drums, and we didn’t want to get strike 2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So we rushed through everything, spending most of our time, from 5:30 to 7:30 p.m., on Micah’s lead vocals. As soon as they were done, I took over and Gabe and I went through each song doing 2 to 3 takes on the high tenor harmony parts. The problem when recording vocals and doing so many takes on so many songs, is that by the time you’re done, you’ve basically sung the equivalent of a 2 – 3 hour concert, and toward the end you start to lose your voice. On one song, it had such a high part that I had to tell Gabe to skip the 2nd and 3rd takes, and we would have to come back to them on another day, because my voice just wasn’t getting the higher notes as well as I needed it to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We finished up right at 9:00 p.m., and then Gabe started working on instruments and parts that didn’t produce as high of sound levels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On this album, we’re trying to get back to more of a “real” sound, trying to avoid any additional “recording studio fluff” that gets in the way of the real music. Being in a 3 part band, it’s a rough proposition trying to get a full sound out of 3 instruments and voices. One thing that makes that easier is that our music is so grounded in vocal harmony, and that helps fill out the sound to a large degree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, we will probably opt to add some strings, harmonica, and lead/electric parts on a choice selection of songs, but only on the ones that we feel it would add something to the artistic value of the song.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This month we also did more planning for the big CD release party &amp;amp; tour kickoff concert we’ll be doing at the Charleston Civic Center on March 9, 2007. We’ve secured ticket distribution through Ticketmaster, and worked out presale dates &amp;amp; ticket prices for The Collective (our fan club) and The Radical Contingent (our street team). The one thing we haven’t decided is who our opening act will be. So this month, we’re asking all our readers to email us your ideas and let us know what your favorite local or regional band or artist is. &lt;a href="http://www.reddingbrothers.com/index.php?option=com_contact&amp;amp;task=view&amp;amp;contact_id=1&amp;amp;Itemid=74"&gt;Email us here&lt;/a&gt;.

Expressed in the most generous way, it's the idea that when Jesus died, his righteousness got credited to us, and God now considers us righteous without regards to our actual behavior or character.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To many people, this is what grace and forgiveness and salvation means.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this seems problematic to me. It makes Christianity a matter of God's scoreboard in the sky, not something that actually has to do with our quality of life. Taken to its logical conclusion, you would think that you could feel like a guilty miserable wretch all of your life, and still hold forth your existence as the Christian ideal. After all, it's not about &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; righteousness, it's about imputed righteousness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was my assumption for much of my theological life. But reading the apostle Paul and some of the other New Testament letters made me increasingly uncomfortable with the idea. Paul didn't just claim that his hearers had been cleansed from their sins in some abstract sense, he claimed that they had been cleansed from their consciousness of guilt, from their awareness of sin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That he could make such a claim struck me as remarkable. I certainly couldn't say that about the Christians I knew, many of whom were wracked with guilt and insecurity. And Paul didn't seem to think that this was an incidental point, he seemed to think this was a major point (if not &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; point) of Christianity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paul seemed to believe that the message of Jesus actually removes the feeling of guilt and sin from its hearers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I realized this is what he was saying, I couldn't understand how it was possible. But I saw that this would be a much more consequential, much more concrete, thing. The scriptures wouldn't be seen as talking about invisible scoreboards and diagrams, but about real changes in the minds and emotions of human beings. Christianity would be about the kind of life one can experience after being freed from guilt, the real-world transformation brought about by Jesus' message. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My mind had switched tracks.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2007/10/16/things-to-learn-in-lexington/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2007/10/16/things-to-learn-in-lexington/</link><pubDate>Tue Oct 16 21:11:00 CDT 2007</pubDate><title>Things to Learn in Lexington</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>A couple of points:Towers are tall.

In this, I'm sketching out in quick narrative form a synthesis of many different ideas. See my references &lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/03/11/references-christianity-anthropology"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My &lt;a href=""&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt; described how humans became evil. Now, I want to describe how this evil came to be focused on the destruction of ancient Israel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I detailed in my previous post, as soon as human beings became truly aware of their own mortality, they were consumed by a deep and abiding fear. This fear allowed those with violent power to enslave thousands of people simultaneously - achieving a sort of control dramatically out of proportion to their actual strength. But being enslaved by violence creates the urge to possess that power yourself. And so the greater the oppression became, the more people came to long for violence, both hating and lusting after that which controlled them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This dynamic quickly spiralled into a world-wide worship of blood, with the warlords wielding this &lt;em&gt;power of the gods&lt;/em&gt;, and all of society arranging itself around them. If violence was the power that could control fear, then violence would be the lord of this world, and everyone, from small to great, would struggle to be close to this god whose power could save them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in a world that worshipped violence, society could erupt at any time. A small infraction could send an entire kingdom into civil war. And this is what happened - civilizations would rise and fall, leaving almost nothing but ash and blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until the warlords found a solution. If one person could be blamed for society's conflict, then the entire people could unite against this victim, unleash their violence, and appease their anger. In doing so, they would restore harmony to the nation, strengthen their bonds by joining against a common enemy, and satisfy their thirst for blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is called the scapegoat mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It worked beautifully. No longer would kingdoms have to fall beneath their own anger; instead, they could simply sacrifice their weakest members for the preservation of society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But crucial to this plan was that society &lt;em&gt;truly believe&lt;/em&gt; their victims to be guilty, deserving of death. And so it became necessary for someone to advocate for these killings, to pick the victim and place the blame, to choose the most appropriate scapegoat for the group slaughter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This someone was called the &lt;em&gt;priest&lt;/em&gt;. This someone would assure the mob that the one they killed deserved to die, that this death was what the gods wanted, and that with this killing, the wrath of the blood-gods was satisfied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was how human civilization started, hand in hand with the religion of death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when Israel began, something changed. Just like every other nation, they had their blood-god, who would lead them in battle, and allow them to exercise violence. Just like every other nation, this blood-god demanded a sacrifice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And so Abraham, father of the Jewish people, went out in the desert to sacrifice his son Isaac.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He tied Isaac to the altar, pulled out his knife, and raised it to strike. And then God stopped his hand, and broke ranks with the blood-gods of the ancient world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Isaac became the father of the Jewish people, and Israel became what was possibly the first nation descended from someone &lt;em&gt;under&lt;/em&gt; the knife. Other nations were founded by the ones who struck. Other nations were founded by the ones who chose the scapegoat and led it to slaughter. Israel became the nation founded by the scapegoat itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This distinction grew over time. Gradually they came to see their God as being a lone voice of dissent in a world of human sacrifice. And as his people, they were a standing protest against that world. This wasn't just a religious difference. Deep down, Israel knew that &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; were the ones every other god would have killed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their very existence unmasked the system that ruled humanity. Because Israel had been under the knife, their survival exposed the scapegoat mechanism for what it was - the mass killing of the innocent. And because civilization depended on the scapegoat mechanism to survive, Israel and the ancient world were fundamentally opposed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus the main subject of the Hebrew bible: Israel against the gods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Israel knew they had been marked. They were the scapegoats, the fitting victims. Their survival revealed the power-systems of the ancient world to be built on lies. And this meant that, like it or not, they were locked in a never-ending battle between them and the gods of blood.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2011/10/30/how-1-corinthians-11-actually-statement-about-female-equality/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2011/10/30/how-1-corinthians-11-actually-statement-about-female-equality/</link><pubDate>Sun Oct 30 21:28:23 CDT 2011</pubDate><title>How 1 Corinthians 11 is actually a statement about female equality</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>1 Corinthians 11 is one of the most interesting statements about female equality in the scriptures.

Certainly, it's not the most clear. Nor is it the most profound - and yet, because it exposes the fault lines of Paul's thinking, it really is one of the most indicative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're not familiar with 1 Corinthians 11, it's the weird uncle of scripture passages, the basis of many strange ideas, the one set of verses that even the extreme preachers often skip over. It deals with the subject of head-coverings or veils, the New Testament's version of the burka. If you don't know any of this, please take a glance at &lt;a href="http://studylight.org/desk/?query=1co+11:1&amp;t=nas&amp;st=1&amp;new=1&amp;sr=1&amp;sc=1&amp;l=en"&gt;the passage&lt;/a&gt;. Got it? Okay, here we go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paul had started his message to the gentile world by talking about how &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/2007/01/15/who-is-god-the-secret-of-the-new-covenant"&gt;God is spirit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, a being not affected or influenced by the kinds of things that human beings use to divide up their world. As such, he had no need of temples, and as such, he did not discriminate between people on the basis of external ethnic or other markers (Acts 17:24-31). This is a direct continuation of Jesus' line of thought in John 4, where he broke all social convention by sitting down at a well, as a Jewish man in the middle of Samaria, talking privately to a disreputable Samaritan woman, and expressed to her the core of his message: that God is spirit, and so God does not care about the location of one's worship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This theme had been picked up by Peter, when, as he was declaring the christian message to the Jewish nation, he quoted Joel 2:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the last days, God says,&lt;br/&gt;   I will pour out my Spirit on all people.&lt;br/&gt;Your sons and daughters will prophesy,&lt;br/&gt;   your young men will see visions,&lt;br/&gt;   your old men will dream dreams.&lt;br/&gt;Even on my servants, both men and women,&lt;br/&gt;   I will pour out my Spirit in those days,&lt;br/&gt;   and they will prophesy. (Acts 2:17-18) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;   &lt;br/&gt;...indicating that a primary feature of the New Covenant would be the presence of God's spirit among all people, including men and women, and the resultant elevation of even female servants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But back to Paul. Paul made this connection explicit in his letter to the Galatians, tying together the presence of God's spirit with the idea that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, nor is there male and female (Galatians 3:28)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;So when we get to 1 Corinthians, we need to understand that Paul had been already been spreading his message of equality among humans far and wide. The Corinthians had received his message, and had gone about applying it to often extreme degrees. The first letter to the Corinthians is not his first message to them - on the contrary, it's a response to &lt;em&gt;their response&lt;/em&gt; to his message.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paul spends most of his letter correcting the over-zealous and abusive applications of things he had told them. So when we get to chapter 11 we need to keep in mind that what Paul is correcting are his &lt;em&gt;own ideas&lt;/em&gt; - taken too far. In fact, that's how he starts his discourse - praising them for trying to follow his teachings and example, before he sets out to suggest that they've taken it in the wrong direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Corinthian women had apparently taken to the idea of their equality to heart. Not only were they praying and prophesying, participating openly in public, they had removed their veils, the symbol that they were married.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It made sense. They were equal, right? Why should they continue to wear something that might indicate someone else's influence over them? Male and female didn't matter, why should they continue to wear a symbol of their femininity?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this was incredibly offensive. It was like simultaneously throwing away your wedding ring, and burning your bra in public. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So Paul makes a very delicate argument, trying to give them a rationale for not ticking off everyone around them, while still holding on to their sense of equality. He makes an argument about &lt;em&gt;source&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, the text says "head", and it is conventional to take this as some kind of a statement about authority structures and dominance, but that's not what "head" means. In Greek usage, the word head indicated either your literal head, or metaphorically, the source of something, like a stream or a river. &lt;a href="#footnote-head"&gt;*&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So Paul brings in the Genesis 2 creation story to try to talk about how some things come from other things, and how it is appropriate to show some kind of respect towards that. This is kind of like arguing that you should respect your grandmother. No one would argue that your grandmother is more important than you, or should have authority over you, and yet most of us would think it's tasteful to show some kind of deference to the fact that she helped bring you into existence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don't know about you, but when I spend time with my grandmother, I try not to embarrass her in public. If we're in a store, or walking somewhere, I don't feel the need to constantly point out that I'm a grown man and can do whatever I want. I don't wear clothes that she'll find terribly offensive, or do some of the ridiculous things that I might feel comfortable with, but would make her nervous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paul is making a similar argument here. Why embarrass your husband? Why get him mocked by the rest of the community? Maybe even more importantly, why give other people a reason to think you might be engaged in some kind of orgy?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's fascinating is the response Paul expects. He anticipates an argument that as christians, they don't care at all about cultural or external physical markers. He accepts that as legitimate, but tries to prove that in fact, they &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; care, and are being inconsistent. He suggests that if they really don't care, they should just shave their heads, traipse around looking like prostitutes, and be done with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why is he so concerned? Because this isn't being done in dark rooms with closed doors. People are watching. The reference to "angels" in verse 10 is not talking about spirit beings (who would have no concern for head-coverings!), it's talking about "messengers", people who are gossiping about what they see, spreading it to the whole town. &lt;a href="#footnote-angel"&gt;*&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These early christian get-togethers had to be the subject of great curiosity. &lt;em&gt;They are letting women speak! They are having slaves sit at the table!&lt;/em&gt; People were paying attention to every move, and Paul is concerned about sending the wrong message. You can almost hear him whisper it: &lt;em&gt;someone's at the window!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In all of this, as in all other places, Paul walks a thin line. He wants christians to be acting out of a new conception of society, where men and women, Jew and Greek, slaves and slave-holders, all have to live together in real relationship. Nothing can compromise that scandalous message, because it is core to what they are doing. And yet, Paul does not want to stir up trouble for themselves on other issues. Just because it's okay to break local customs and desecrate sacred cows, doesn't mean that's the best choice. Better to pick their fights, so that the core message is clear, and there is nothing else to criticize them for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nowhere in this does Paul suggest that the women should stop displaying their equality. They are to continue speaking and participating (verse 5), they are to understand that they are all interdependent and that no one is over another (verse 11), and most tellingly, they are ultimately to &lt;em&gt;make up their own minds&lt;/em&gt; - because it is the woman's own choice (verse 10), and no one should argue about the decision they make (verse 16).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paul cares a lot. He makes a strong argument. But when it comes down to it, his ultimate statement is that each individual is free to make their own decision. Unlike every other structure on earth, the kingdom of God is the place where all are equal and free, and where no one can dominate another. Not even an apostle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a id="footnote-head"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; A short defense of this meaning of "head" is &lt;a href="http://www.friktech.com/rel/women.htm"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; in section three. Read the definition &lt;a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dkefalh%2F"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a id="footnote-angel"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The Greek word for "angel" is literally "messenger", and can variously reference spiritual entities who act as messengers, or human beings who act as messengers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

My first thought was that something had fallen out of the back of their truck, and so I slowed down to avoid whatever it was that had fallen out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then I saw a backpack. I was still slowing down when I saw the body crumpled in the road. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I stopped the car, and started fumbling for the hazard lights. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We were in the right lane, the body was in the left lane, and cars were approaching behind me. I was terrified they were going to come speeding through and hit it again and again. I began blaring the horn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cars behind me slowed and stopped, and I jumped out and approached the body. Emily was out of the car, dialing 911.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After that, there were a lot of events, a lot of people, a lot of questions. It was a 25-year old boy, and he had apparently died on impact. When I got to him, he was completely motionless, not breathing, not pulsing. He wasn't even bleeding, something that would have seemed more alive at that moment. I kept thinking that if the emergency people could just get there, they might be able to save him. But that didn't really make sense - he was already gone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those are the basics of what happened. Here's what I want to say about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am sad for his family. I am sad for the person who hit him. I know that they probably panicked and ran off, and are now hiding somewhere, scared and isolated, not knowing if there was anything they could have done, not knowing how to process that horrible accident. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But I am so grateful that no one else hit him. I am so grateful that no one else had to question whether they were involved in his death. I am so grateful that we were able to stop in time, and were able to stop the rest of the traffic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am thankful that he didn't suffer for a long time, there on the road, unable to move. I am thankful that his death was quick and quiet and as dignified as you could hope for in that situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a terrible and tragic event, but in the face of all that could have gone worse, I have so much gratitude.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2005/04/05/vh1-gr8/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2005/04/05/vh1-gr8/</link><pubDate>Tue Apr 05 00:13:00 CDT 2005</pubDate><title>VH1 - GR8</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>Friday night with Junior at Common Grounds was great - he turned out to be a highly creative songwriter, one of the most interesting I've seen.

Siah, though, was stuck in Nashville and did't make it until our show was over. Which meant that Gabe and I had to play by ourselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So that was an interesting twist on things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We spent the night in Georgetown (right above Lexington), and then headed up to Dayton through blinding rain and wind. We thought we were done for, but neither snow, nor rain, nor dark of night will keep us from our appointed tourdates. Almost makes you feel patriotic. Errr...anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So we played at the VH1 Save The Music concert (at the &lt;a href="http://www.udayton.edu/"&gt;University of Dayton&lt;/a&gt;), which was awesome. The fraternity girls (yes, you read right...we were confused too) who hosted it were in Sigma Alpha Iota. Okay, we admit it, they were awesome, even if they &lt;i&gt;were&lt;/i&gt; MEAN to us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So then we headed home, stopping off at Taco Bell to fill Gabe's ravenous hunger before plunging onward into the night towards WV. Another mission accomplished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-micah&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2005/05/02/movie-the-buried-secret-of-m-night-shyamalan/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2005/05/02/movie-the-buried-secret-of-m-night-shyamalan/</link><pubDate>Mon May 02 10:05:00 CDT 2005</pubDate><title>MOVIE - The Buried Secret of M Night Shyamalan</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>Nice....</description><content:encoded>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Nice.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2011/05/13/ancient-israelite-violence-and-the-morality-of-roadkill/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2011/05/13/ancient-israelite-violence-and-the-morality-of-roadkill/</link><pubDate>Fri May 13 11:55:37 CDT 2011</pubDate><title>Ancient Israelite Violence and The Morality of Roadkill</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>This morning I started thinking about a Jewish law which prohibits prostitutes from putting money into the temple treasury.

I've always had a problem with this idea - after all, why should you avoid doing something good (contributing to the temple) just because you did something bad (prostitution) in the past? And why shouldn't the temple accept this money for the good of the society? And since all money is the same, the money will ultimately become part of the broader economy anyway, and eventually make its way into the temple treasury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what's the problem? Why this concern?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; what the law is trying to do is to build compassion. If we accept the benefits of certain activities (prostitution, thievery, warfare), it becomes very hard for us to mentally separate ourselves from those activities. The benefits coming to us become a corrupting force, sneaking into our consciousness, and contaminating our entire selves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm not an &lt;a href="#footnote-vegetarian"&gt;ethical vegetarian&lt;/a&gt; (I'm a "taste" vegetarian), but this is really easy to see when applied to animals. There are some vegans who will not buy meat (for fear of encouraging animal slaughter), but who will eat meat that is already killed (roadkill, for example - I'm not making &lt;a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Eat-Roadkill"&gt;this up&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this becomes really problematic. If you eat and enjoy dead animal flesh, but don't believe in killing animals, what is your secret wish? Wouldn't you slowly begin hoping to find a dead animal? Wouldn't you begin wishing to find an animal killed in an accident? Wouldn't your compassion for animals ultimately become warped into a kind of moral absolutism, and an attempt to find loopholes? What would keep you from gradually accepting free burgers from friends, eventually even suggesting they buy them for you?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At some point your rational moral stance becomes a rationalization for whatever you want to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, if you refuse animal meat whatsoever, your compassion will gradually become strengthened. Eating meat will seem more and more strange to you. The horror of animal death will become clearer and clearer. You will become a more and more extreme vegan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It occurs to me that this is connected to the ancient Israelite wars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the early parts of the Jewish bible, there is a lot of bothersome destruction - cases where God apparently commands his people to go in and kill men, women, and children. This purported genocide of the native Canaanites is a tough point in the bible, making it hard to argue for the morality Jesus exhorted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lot of people have spent great effort defending the rightness of this slaughter at that particular point in history. I'm not going to get into that quagmire. What I want to do instead, is question what the text might be telling us on a larger level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A curious fact about this destruction is that in many of the cases, the Israelites were ordered to utterly destroy everything taken in the battle. They were to take no plunder, no spoils, because this destruction was to be "holy".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joshua 6-7 gives the account of Achan keeping some plunder from the destruction of Jericho for himself. As a result, the Israelites are punished (losing their next battle), until they find out about the offending contaminant hidden among them. Once they have rectified this problem (killing Achan and burning everything he took), they return to their successful campaign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why is this so important?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even in these early, brutal chapters of the bible, we see a move away from violence. The identity of the Israelite people was never supposed to be a conquering empire, but a peaceful society living within its own borders. And as a result, it was important that Israel not become addicted to killing, not begin to value death for its own benefits, and certainly not to value conquest for what spoils they could take. &lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#footnote-brutal"&gt;*&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;King David, later on, becomes the subject of just this sort of distancing. His successful but violent kingship "did what was necessary" for Israel to become established, but he is forbidden from creating a temple. He is a violent man, and the temple will not benefit so directly from the results of violence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're reading this as an attempt to defend the violence that happened, don't.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if you live in an extremely brutal world and society, and you wish to move towards compassion, what is your first step? Wouldn't it be to introduce space between the necessity of violence you see around you, and the enjoyment of that violence? Wouldn't it be to remove the profit motive of killing, eradicating that particular "conflict of interest"? And wouldn't it ultimately be to establish the concept of an idealized "holy space", which might acknowledge the existence of terrible things in the world around it, but would never allow them to enter its own peaceful sanctuary?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;FOOTNOTES:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a id="footnote-vegetarian"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;1) An ethical vegetarian refuses to eat animals because of concern for animal rights. I choose not to eat meat because I don't like the taste/texture/concept. So I call myself a "taste vegetarian". Nevertheless, above, I'm arguing using ethical vegetarian thought-processes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a id="footnote-brutal"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;2) In fact, some of the most brutal elements of these stories (killing women and children), should possibly be read as a refusal to benefit from war. At this point in time, women captives would have been considered plunder. Killing them instead is a move to prevent the most extreme forms of war-lust from taking hold.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/03/10/escaping-google/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/03/10/escaping-google/</link><pubDate>Sat Mar 10 22:27:13 CST 2012</pubDate><title>Escaping Google</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>Recently Google has changed its privacy policy, causing a lot of people to feel uneasy about the amount of search history that Google has on them.

Google's &lt;a href="http://www.dataliberation.org/google/web-history"&gt;Data Liberation Front&lt;/a&gt; has an explanation of how to download this history, but it only includes the past 100 entries. So I searched a little deeper, and found this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://geeklad.com/updated-script-to-download-google-history"&gt;Script to download Google Web History&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You basically install this as a bookmark, and then go to &lt;a href="http://google.com/history"&gt;http://google.com/history&lt;/a&gt;, click the bookmarklet, and let it export &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of your history as a CSV file. Which is exactly what I wanted. After storing this file, I then felt free to delete all my past history per the above instructions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This won't help with Youtube history, but for me, that wasn't nearly as much information.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/06/12/process/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/06/12/process/</link><pubDate>Tue Jun 12 22:50:04 CDT 2012</pubDate><title>The Process</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>*I'm in the middle of a 40-day, 16-stop, 14-country tour of the world.*

Make it through customs. Explain that no, we're not carrying any baggage except these two backpacks. Fight off the taxi drivers, hungry for a taste of American spending habits. (We are always a disappointment.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Try to figure out if this city runs on buses, trains, or foot-power. Find the quickest way to their most widespread and cheapest form of transportation. This isn't easy - airports hide local transport well, but advertise all kinds of over-priced "expresses" that take you right past the most interesting places and into the areas optimized for spending money. Finding the information we need sometimes means cornering locals, hacking someone's wireless network, or just trying risky things that may or may not work out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Change any money we have into local currency. This won't be a lot - usually just enough to pay bus drivers or whichever form of transportation requires coinage. The money changers give us weird looks. Sometimes they don't have what we need - Nepal, for instance, runs on a currency even their government won't accept. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take the local transport to a place we can spend the night. This forces us to figure out local customs, local currency, and local geography, all in the process of getting there. We also have to learn to read their signs, and navigate the peculiarities of their transit system (in Hong Kong, they don't give you change, in New Zealand, they operate on the honor system, in Nepal, every form of public transportation involves being touched intimately by strangers).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the currency, try to come up with a mental trick for remembering the exchange rates, so we don't get scammed. If their money is a half, or a quarter, or a tenth of ours, then it's easy. Most of the time, it's more difficult. My overall pattern is to figure out the order of magnitude (pesos are roughly &lt;em&gt;1000&lt;/em&gt; times less valuable than the US dollar), and only then worry about the multiplier (1000 Chilean pesos is worth &lt;em&gt;2&lt;/em&gt; US dollars). That way if I screw up, I don't screw up quite so bad. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another trick? Almost every currency uses bills for amounts greater than $1 US, and coins for amounts less than that, no matter what units they count in. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we've managed to get to a place we can spend the night, then most of our problems are solved. We've reverse-engineered the most essential skills necessary for survival in our new location. We've gotten our feet wet dealing with the local people, and working across whatever kind of language barrier there is. We know how to travel. The city is ours. &lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2014/09/28/reading-list/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2014/09/28/reading-list/</link><pubDate>Sun Sep 28 17:47:17 CDT 2014</pubDate><title>Reading List</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>It’s about time I have a recommended reading list.

If you want to get inside my head (why would you want that??!!), this is what you need to read.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Non-fiction:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The Physics of Immortality (Frank Tipler)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book is a mind-warping exploration of ideas at the largest scale, and for me, it drove home the incredible necessity of life as a unified pursuit. In other words, we can’t have religious strivings, and political strivings, and economic strivings, and individual strivings, all living in their own separate worlds. They &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; be connected and mutually reinforcing — or else we all live in a chaotic, self-destructive reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind (Julian Jaynes)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book is an exploration of what consciousness is (in a very analytical way), a hypothesis about the rapid, recent development of modern consciousness from a hypothesized earlier form, and an exploration of human history, religion, poetry, and civilization in that light. The effect of this book on me was to fully affirm rationality, and simultaneously give far greater weight to ancient accounts of semi-mythological experiences. While these accounts aren’t “objective”, they might very well have been psychologically real, and not at all uncommon or unhealthy. And the explanation of music that this book provides — essentially a channel back to that earlier mentality — has profoundly resonated with me and informed my work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The Gifts of The Jews (Thomas Cahill)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book suggests that concepts which arose in the unique experience of the ancient Jewish people have profoundly reshaped our world. For example, the story of Abraham is to a large extent the story of a man stepping out of a society which saw history as cyclical, predestined, and unchanging, and creating a society which saw history as linear, progressive, and profoundly dependent on individual action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The Powers That Be (Walter Wink)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book suggests that the ancient idea of “principalities and powers” (ie, spiritual forces behind political institutions) isn’t simply a superstition, but is in fact a sober way to discuss the psychological dimensions of the socio-political world. It then explores the New Testament as a savvy handbook on non-violent resistance, and explores how similar dynamics are still at work in the world today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Ishmael (Daniel Quinn)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This fictional story is not really a work of fiction, but a work of philosophy narrated by a telepathic gorilla. I ultimately break pretty substantially with the hard primitivism advocated by this book, but find it illuminating for its analysis of the Cain and Abel story, particularly in combination with &lt;em&gt;The Origin of Consciousness&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Gifts of the Jews&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Fiction:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The Riverworld Series (Farmer)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;All humans who have ever lived wake up resurrected alongside a giant, unending river. Their needs are supplied, they cannot die, and they have no idea what is going on. The charm of this story is in how it follows different historic characters (Samuel Clemens, Richard Francis Burton), as they begin to investigate, revolt against, and reshape their world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The Foundation Trilogy (Asimov)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve said that this series is basically the Old Testament in space, and not only does it read that way, but when I first read it as a teenager, it ended up changing the way I read the Old Testament. It explores in a unique way the really intense dynamics of having a feeling of purpose or destiny — and how that leads to perplexing questions on whether to give up action, and just go with the flow; whether to try to discover the steps that are “pre-ordained”, and just go with those; or whether to actually fight against that destiny with all of your might.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;More (to be expanded on):&lt;/h2&gt;

For the disciples, the hardest thing to believe was that they were going to come to possess the Roman Empire, and build a new civilization, and it was all going to happen by giving themselves up for dead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those few dozen people, barely holding it together, were going to build a new world order, and they were going to do this without weapons, without military strategy, without intrigue, without political power. They would have to be willing to practice peace in the face of torture and incredible violence, and doing so would somehow secure their victory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They could hardly imagine such a thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The meek would inherit the earth. &lt;em&gt;That&lt;/em&gt; is the hardest thing to believe in the New Testament.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It took a guy rising from the dead to convince the disciples of it. It took him appearing to them again and again to give them the courage to think it might be true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking back, we’re in a very different boat. We know that Jesus was right. We know that the meek did inherit the earth. We know that those few dozen people did go on to build a new world, without a single military conquest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And this gives us pause — it makes us look again at the event that convinced them. It’s almost unimaginable to think that a guy might have risen from the dead — but at least we’re not &lt;em&gt;them&lt;/em&gt;, trying to convince ourselves that the Roman Empire was going to fall before a group of people who never even lifted a sword.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/how-to-handle-gods-audacious-vision-for-humanity/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/how-to-handle-gods-audacious-vision-for-humanity/</link><pubDate>Tue Feb 21 16:04:57 CST 2017</pubDate><title>How to handle God’s audacious vision for humanity</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>I’ve recently been rediscovering how truly audacious [the biblical vision for humanity](http://micahredding.com/blog/partnership-with-god) is.

According to even a cursory reading of the scriptures, humanity is made in the image of God, given charge of the entire world, and called to participate with God in his ongoing acts of creation. In the New Testament, this is amplified even further, to the point where humans are reigning with Christ, defeating death, and judging cosmic beings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s hard not to be a bit shocked at how incredible these scriptural claims are. Most Christians actually feel pretty uncomfortable with them, and so tend to downplay them in some way. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But discomfort isn’t much of an answer. It’s actually more of a question—what makes us so uncomfortable about these ideas?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doubtless, there are all kinds of reasons, some better than others. Some people are just so dead-set on feeling like a &lt;em&gt;wretch&lt;/em&gt; and a &lt;em&gt;worm&lt;/em&gt;, that they don’t have much room in their lives for God to be putting them in charge of the cosmos. Others are addicted to a sense of helplessness, which these audacious scriptures tend to undermine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But for some, the concern is more practical. They’re afraid that if other people start talking about this stuff too much, they’ll become conceited, arrogant, and disruptive. They might abandon a sense of responsibility, ignore their morality, and spin off into decadence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure that fear is entirely without merit. But to the extent it does have merit—I think it points to an issue with people’s moral education.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After all, why would grandiose ideas suddenly cause someone to lose their sense of morality and responsibility?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s only one reason I can think of—if their sense of morality and responsibility was based on fear. If it was, then any kind of sense that you don’t need to be afraid would tend to disrupt your morals. And the bigger the world you’re aware of—the less you might feel the need to fear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this context, then, such ideas would be dangerous. But the answer is not to run from the ideas—it’s to build your morality on a stronger foundation. A foundation not made of sand. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is why, in the scriptures, these statements of the glorification and exaltation of human beings are combined with statements about human purpose and responsibility. And when we get to the New Testament, they’re combined with statements about intense suffering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simple moralizing won’t cut it. Guilt is not a sufficient motivation to direct the actions of someone suddenly given vast power. Instead, you must be driven by &lt;em&gt;purpose&lt;/em&gt;, by a responsibility that comes from within, and draws you forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/christianity-is-love"&gt;Another name for this is love&lt;/a&gt;. Intense, world-embracing, self-sacrificial love. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And in the scriptures, this is precisely what unlocks all the scriptural promise of humanity. Christ is the one who embodies and becomes this love—and it is through union with him that we become capable of exercising our God-given powers without collapsing under their weight.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2007/09/26/cupid-takes-on-the-world/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2007/09/26/cupid-takes-on-the-world/</link><pubDate>Wed Sep 26 14:04:00 CDT 2007</pubDate><title>Cupid Takes on The World</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>This past weekend, I was at a conference where entertainers of all types performed in front of college students from all over.

We performed too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the performances that struck me was a "spoken word" poet who talked loudly and eloquently about the joys of being a high-school virgin, ala Napoleon Dynamite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the poem that struck me the most was called "I am Cupid", I believe. In it, he talks about being Cupid, and all the things he can do to people to make them fall in love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then he stops, and notes that he is beginning to feel like an underachiever. So he turns his bow on various nations of the world in turn, igniting each nation into vigorous passion for the other. Iran and Israel, France and Croatia; each one gives in to wild, passionate romance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It struck me as a very biblical metaphor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-micah&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2007/04/21/a-new-song-a-week/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2007/04/21/a-new-song-a-week/</link><pubDate>Sat Apr 21 22:39:00 CDT 2007</pubDate><title>A New Song-A-Week</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>In case you hadn't read our website recently, we've embarked on a new project: to write a new song every week, record it, and release it by Saturday night at  midnight.It's a tough gig forcing creativ...</description><content:encoded>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;In case you hadn't read our website recently, we've embarked on a new project: to write a new song every week, record it, and release it by Saturday night at midnight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's a tough gig forcing creativity upon yourself. But it's also a liberating one, and an inspiring one, and a re-awakening one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I had been in a creative slumber because it was Winter. Maybe it's getting close to Summer, and it's time to re-awaken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've started working out, I've started writing a new song a week, I've started spending more time with friends, and more time outside in the sunlight. I've got renewed purpose, perhaps. And there's nothing like a self-challenge to keep you awake and alive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, tonight at midnight we should have a new song for you. If we finish it. :) Stay tuned...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See the &lt;a href="http://www.reddingbrothers.com/content/category/6/18/37/"&gt;First Song-A-Week&lt;/a&gt;, from last week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/reddingbrothersvideopodcast"&gt;Subscribe to the Song-A-Week&lt;/a&gt;, and get the new one tonight.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2006/11/22/polar-bear-tshirt/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2006/11/22/polar-bear-tshirt/</link><pubDate>Wed Nov 22 23:40:00 CST 2006</pubDate><title>Polar Bear Tshirt</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>This is the Shirt you've been waiting for.

Any time something valuable is discovered, whether it be diamonds, gold, or rubber, the locals suffer and die for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Africa has problems. And I don't have any really adequate grasp on the extent of their problems. But I have often wondered "why?". Why is it that America prospers, while Africa does not? Why do they have AIDS and conflict diamonds, and child soldiers, etc, etc, while America, England, Europe, and most other places do not really have these issues in anywhere near the same degree?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe the answer lies in politics. When a group of people can't utilize their environment to pull themselves out of poverty, we know it is not their environment (rich and productive as ALL of the earth is), or their people (any people can work and advance themselves), or their past (anyone can overcome their past).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is either something fundamentally wrong with &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;them&lt;/span&gt;, or there is something wrong with their system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don't believe that God made some humans better and some worse than others. So I believe that the source of the continuing and ever-growing issues in Africa is corrupt politics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Politicians are the reason why foreign aid doesn't help those who need it most, food and clothing donations don't go to the poor, and people turn and declare war on their neighbors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wrongs committed provoke vengeance and hatred, and spur on other wrongs, and so a cycle is created. Politicians corrupt, and their efforts often lead to generations of wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I truly believe that no other explanation can really account for the lack of progress that continent has had. Only when humanity is put in a strangle-hold by political structures and organizations, does it stop flourishing and innovating. Only then can a people fall backwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-micah&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2006/11/22/the-christian-libertarian-revolution/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2006/11/22/the-christian-libertarian-revolution/</link><pubDate>Wed Nov 22 21:02:00 CST 2006</pubDate><title>The Christian Libertarian Revolution</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>It's coming, I know it is.

The time when Christians will wake up and realize that:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"Any government powerful enough to give you whatever you want is also powerful enough to take away everything you have."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Christians will need to learn to distance themselves from the politics of power that are so often part of the "christian vocabulary" today. Correspondingly, libertarians will have to wake up to the essential "christian-ness" of their belief system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After all, if we were to decide to create a &lt;span style="font-style:italic;"&gt;truly, deeply, Christian&lt;/span&gt; political party, what principle could be better to enact than "do no harm"? The libertarian position is that we take this principle, and apply it VERY consistently to government.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I have been on a web-search for other Christian Libertarians out there like me.

I may have even heard someone use that as an excuse a time or two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Certainly there are bad things in the world. People starve, politicians are corrupt, teenagers play music too loud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But is that because the world is broken, or is it because we are a species which is continually growing and facing new challenges? "Broken" seems permanent, inescapable, something we can do nothing about. It invites complacency and resignation. At least a few times, I've felt like I was hearing someone use it to excuse their failure to act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I suspect that most people would point to the Genesis story of Adam and Eve to support this view of the world. But is that really what the story tells us?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The overall arc of the story is clear: it's a move from chaos to order, from nothingness to a structure supporting human life. Things don't start good and fall apart, they start dead and come alive. "The earth was formless and empty, and darkness was on the surface of the deep..." - this is how the story begins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The big turn in the story is when God creates humanity. But this is not the end point, it's the beginning; this is why God tells the new human species to "fill the earth and subdue it".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lot of people reading the story jump directly to the part about the Garden of Eden, and assume it is trying to tell us that the world was originally a paradise. But that's the opposite of the point: the world in general was a wild and chaotic place, full of danger, inhospitable to higher life forms. The Garden is planted in the &lt;em&gt;midst&lt;/em&gt; of this world, to give humanity a launching point, a place to be nurtured before taking on the difficult task of gardening the rest of the earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Humanity's role, according to the story, was to improve the world. Yes, everything in this story is declared &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt;. But it's not &lt;em&gt;perfect&lt;/em&gt; - humanity is not being given a pristine environment to experience, it's being given an open wilderness in which to grow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So when Adam and Eve go against God's warnings, they find themselves cast out into the cold world alone. Thus begins human history; but it's not a history that starts with brokenness, it's a history of humanity's premature emergence into adulthood. It's a history of leaving the womb too soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first Christians talked about Jesus in this way: he was the one who was allowing them to finally inherit their birthright. They had been children, now they were becoming adults in the household of God, taking control of what they had been promised all along. God, the gentleman farmer, is turning over his vast estate to his heirs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Farming is not easy. It's an ongoing struggle, one in which you slowly make progress against the elements. But the farmer does not claim his world is broken; he knows it is something to be shaped by his effort, to be tended and cared for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is our world. We are the farmers. The problems we face naturally emerge as we enter new territory, as we tend and grow and cultivate better produce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Confronting every problem with the claim that &lt;em&gt;the world is broken&lt;/em&gt;, seems a lot like the farmer continually blaming the dirt. Yes, dirt can be an obstacle, but that's precisely the farmer's job, to make something good come from it.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/the-infinite-resurrection/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/the-infinite-resurrection/</link><pubDate>Mon Jun 13 23:38:12 CDT 2016</pubDate><title>The Infinite Resurrection</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>A few months ago, I gave a talk entitled “The Infinite Resurrection” at the annual conference of the [Mormon Transhumanist Association](http://transfigurism.org/).

The MTA are always great hosts, and I enjoyed the opportunity to meet and talk with many of the other speakers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like many of the others there, I am not Mormon, and my talk was not on Mormonism. Instead, I spoke about a subject that was extremely important, and yet incredibly controversial, from the very earliest moments of Christianity: The resurrection of the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why was resurrection &lt;em&gt;of the body&lt;/em&gt; considered so important? What was the significance of insisting on the resurrection of the dead, rather than the &lt;em&gt;immortality of the soul&lt;/em&gt; that was so popular with Plato and other philosophers? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Put another way, why did Christians stand out like a sore thumb in the ancient Roman Empire?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this short talk, I give three reasons I think resurrection was so incredibly important to early Christians, and the one thing that was unique in early Christian teaching. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In short, &lt;em&gt;resurrection provokes action&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/K4JGLbVqH9E" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4JGLbVqH9E"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4JGLbVqH9E&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2007/03/29/a-new-kind-of-jesus-billboard/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2007/03/29/a-new-kind-of-jesus-billboard/</link><pubDate>Thu Mar 29 22:28:00 CDT 2007</pubDate><title>A New Kind of Jesus Billboard</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>Hmmmmmm...-micah(PS.

We must learn how life works, how evolution unfolds, how ecosystems function—and we must learn to bless and uplift those processes into glorious flourishing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the creative process that God models for us in Genesis 1—and then immediately calls us into. This is what causes Paul to exclaim: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“All creation waits in eager expectation for the children of God to be revealed...in hopes that creation itself will be liberated to join in the freedom and the glory of the children of God!” (Romans 8:19-21)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is what leads to Revelation's vision of a city so big it can encompass the entire world, so powerful it reaches beyond the stratosphere, and so glorious it pours life and healing into all creation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To do this, we must pour intense research into the fundamentals of life: genetics and cellular structure—epigenetics, metabolism, and intracellular programming—ecosystems, biogenesis, and evolutionary development. We must learn to create, edit, and manage these systems, to resurrect extinct species, give existing species new life, and protect endangered species from extinction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We must not return to a prior ecological state, or be content with simply limiting environmental damage. We must move aggressively forward into an ecosystem that is thriving like never before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And if we do so, then &lt;em&gt;we&lt;/em&gt; will thrive like never before. Not only will we unleash unimaginable global flourishing, we will create a civilization rich beyond its wildest dreams. We will learn to cure disease, to extend life, to grow better food, to need fewer resources, to construct vibrant new ecosystems on other planets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We will learn to optimize the earth for maximum biodiversity—until our oceans are teeming with vast creatures of the deep, our skies are full of glorious life and color, and our plains are bringing forth vegetation that would make Eden weep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our wilds will be full of large creatures, beasts of massive grace and beauty, animals whose names our ancestors first whispered in awe. Our cities will be refreshing beacons of light, skyscrapers literally reaching the skies—not enclosing us in concrete and steel, but raining down nourishment, greenery, and life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the calling of God. It's what we were uniquely made to do. And it is precisely that which most reflects the one whose image we are. It's a calling described over and over in the biblical story, from Genesis to Revelation, from Old Testament to New Testament, from first creation to new creation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's the mission without which all life will perish. It's the mission without which we will be purposeless and lost. It's the mission without which humanity will not prosper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it's the mission that contains everything our creator promised us, on the first day we walked with God in this beautiful, glorious creation.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2008/09/15/there-no-hell-part-5-use-language/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2008/09/15/there-no-hell-part-5-use-language/</link><pubDate>Mon Sep 15 10:40:50 CDT 2008</pubDate><title>There Is No Hell (part 5), The Use of Language</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>THE LANGUAGE OF THE BIBLE

To the original audience, it meant there was no listed genealogy. There are many other examples like this, that defy my instinctual ways of reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once we realize this tremendous difference, we have to fall back on the bible itself to guide us in understanding it. We have to compare how terms are used, what thought patterns they had, etc, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This alone is reliable guide to understanding what was going on 2000 years ago. Our instincts can fail us. The translators can fail us. The commentators and word-definers can fail us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the closer we get to the original documents, and how those documents used language and concepts, the closer we get to the meaning Jesus and his early followers conveyed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One thing we know about their use of language is that it tended towards the poetic, the metaphorical, and the extreme. Jesus spoke almost nothing other than parables. Jesus said disturbing things about eating his body. He talked about the stars falling from the sky, and the earth being shaken. All of this is confusing if we don't look at the biblical language Jesus was drawing upon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of these things have clear explanations, if we look deeply into how these concepts were used elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jesus certainly didn't back down when he described the annihilation of his country-men who had been unfaithful to God. He used language just as extreme, and just as correct. Everything he spoke can be understood in a very direct sense, once we understand how the bible uses terms like "eternal".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not once did he say, "but the unfaithful will enter into a torment that will last forever". Instead, he talks about "destroying soul and body in The Valley of Hinnom", an idea they surely would have understood from the prophets, and from looking out the window. Things go to a burning garbage pit to be totally destroyed. Corpses go there. Garbage goes there. Nothing comes out. Nothing lives there. Nothing is conscious there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He talked about an "eternal punishment" that would result from an "eternal judgment". We are told elsewhere that this "eternal punishment" is equal to "eternal death", and that this makes sense because "the wages of sin is death".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the epistles, the opposite of "eternal life" is "death", not "eternal torture".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE TOUGH ONES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a few more verses that I need to deal with, and in these we find the closest thing to a "proof-text" for hell anyone could offer. All of the preceding words, phrases, and verses tell us a unified story: the eventual fate of the wicked is total destruction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when we get to Revelation, we have two verses that seem to buck this trend, and I want to explore those. Remember, this is in Revelation, a book no one has ever claimed was easy to understand. A normal interpretive rule of bible study is that we interpret the more metaphorical and abstract verses in terms of the more concrete and direct verses. So we shouldn't hang our doctrinal beliefs on one or two verses in Revelation - that we may not understand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Revelation 14:9-12&lt;br/&gt;9 Then another angel, a third one, followed them, saying with a loud voice, "If anyone worships the beast and his image, and receives a mark on his forehead or on his hand, 10 he also will drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is mixed in full strength in the cup of His anger; and he will be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb. 11 "And the smoke of their torment goes up forever and ever; they have no rest day and night, those who worship the beast and his image, and whoever receives the mark of his name."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Revelation 20:10&lt;br/&gt;10 And the devil who deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are also; and they will be tormented day and night forever and ever.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I saved these for last because I believe that without these verses to pin their "proofs" on, mixed-up theologians in the early church never would have been successful at inventing the concept of "hell".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First question: who is mentioned in these verses?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first one mentions those who accept the mark of the beast, the second one includes the beast, the false prophet, and the devil himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In these unique statements about "torment forever", we do not find any of the generic evil people mentioned throughout the bible. Instead, we find the devil himself, with his chief henchmen and closest followers. So perhaps there is a hell, but only these individuals ever experience eternal conscious torment?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe. But let's look at another possibility really quick. In Isaiah 34, God declares that he will destroy the land of Edom completely. These prophecies and metaphors from the Old Testament are the framework from which Revelation was created. Notice how he describes this complete destruction of Edom:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Isaiah 34:9-10&lt;br/&gt;9 Its streams will be turned into pitch, And its loose earth into brimstone, And its land will become burning pitch. 10 It will not be quenched night or day; Its smoke will go up forever. From generation to generation it will be desolate; None will pass through it forever and ever.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sounds like this is going to keep smoking, huh? But why then does he say in the next verse:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Isaiah 34:11 But pelican and hedgehog will possess it, And owl and raven will dwell in it;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do pelicans and hedgehogs like to live in fire? And why in the next verse (12) is he asking about who will be king?! Then, in verses 13-17, he's talking about all the different kinds of animals who will dwell in and possess the land.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Could it be that these are all just different metaphors to express the idea that he's going to destroy this place completely? Edom is not still smoking. But it was destroyed, and so in a figurative way, its smoke goes up forever. The testimony about it is always there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you look at the broad picture of what is going on in Revelation, this makes sense. Revelation's biggest plot line is the destruction of the city of Babylon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Revelation 18:2 And he cried out with a mighty voice, saying, "Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great! She has become a dwelling place of demons and a prison of every unclean spirit, and a prison of every unclean and hateful bird.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alright, so here is Babylon's destruction - being filled with birds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Revelation 18:8 "For this reason in one day her plagues will come, pestilence and mourning and famine, and she will be burned up with fire; for the Lord God who judges her is strong.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And here's the destruction again, except this time it includes PESTILENCE and FAMINE and FIRE. I don't know if you've noticed, but these things can't all literally happen in one day. It is meaningless to talk about a one-day famine on the same day that your city is burned up with fire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's happening is that strong metaphors are being used to talk about how completely God is going to wipe this place out. Just like in Isaiah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Revelation 18:9-10&lt;br/&gt;9 "And the kings of the earth, who committed acts of immorality and lived sensuously with her, will weep and lament over her when they see the smoke of her burning, 10 standing at a distance because of the fear of her torment, saying, `Woe, woe, the great city, Babylon, the strong city! For in one hour your judgment has come.'&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They see the place burn in one hour (wait, what happened to one day?), and they stand back because they don't want to be involved in this destruction, this torment. God is not intending to somehow make this city stay around forever, just to be tormented. No, the torment talked about here IS the destruction. It's just another figurative way of speaking about the very real destruction of a very real city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Revelation 18:21&lt;br/&gt;21 Then a strong angel took up a stone like a great millstone and threw it into the sea, saying, "So will Babylon, the great city, be thrown down with violence, and will not be found any longer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What God intends to do to Babylon, "tormenting" and burning it, will mean it completely ceases to exist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Revelation 19:1-3&lt;br/&gt;1 After these things I heard something like a loud voice of a great multitude in heaven...3 And a second time they said, "Hallelujah! HER SMOKE RISES UP FOREVER AND EVER."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The destruction of Babylon is complete. It has been burnt in "one hour". It can no longer be found. But "the smoke" of this rises up forever and ever. He's not saying Babylon is still around in any way. He's saying the destruction, the burning, is permanent. The fact that it burned lasts forever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is what I believe all of these verses in Revelation are saying. Just like in Isaiah, just like with Babylon, the wicked are totally and completely destroyed. And their destruction is related to us in a variety of strong metaphors (torment, smoke rising forever, birds inhabiting) that cannot literally be true, but serve to help us understand the severity and completeness of this destruction.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2010/04/22/how-christianity-sold-its-soul/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2010/04/22/how-christianity-sold-its-soul/</link><pubDate>Thu Apr 22 12:46:23 CDT 2010</pubDate><title>How Christianity Sold its Soul</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>In 325 AD, Christianity sold its soul to Constantine and the Roman Empire.

The most peaceful movement in world history beat their plows into swords, and their pruning hooks into knives. And so began the bloodbath.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How could they have done this?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jesus and the Empire were diametrically opposed. The Empire was built on the ends justifying the means - They wanted peace, and they would kill hundreds of thousands of people to get it. Jesus, in contrast, argued that the ends WERE the means - If you wanted peace, you had to practice peace. Those who lived by the sword would die by the sword - reaping what they sowed. No matter how noble your cause, if you approached it through violent means, you would always achieve violent ends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How could Christianity, built on Jesus' life and work, turn around and trade in Jesus' logic for the logic of the Empire? What twist of thinking could result in such a radical change? How could this happen?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is PRECISELY by abandoning the fulfilled eschatology of the early Christians that such a radical change could take place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the kingdom of God had come, then it is obvious that the kingdom was not something that could be enhanced with bloodshed and warfare. If the kingdom had come, then the task before Christians was to begin the hard work of healing the world, making peace, and resisting oppression through the strength of self-giving love, after the model of Jesus of Nazareth. If the kingdom had come, then the only way to build the kingdom was to practice non-violent grace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if the kingdom had &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; come, then the way the kingdom was envisioned could by subtly changed. Rather than a bottom-up paradoxical presence of God, rather than a transformative community of peace, the kingdom could become a utopian dream of a Christian Empire. And that dream was only one step away from becoming an impetus for violent empire-building.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only by giving up fulfilled eschatology, by letting go of a present and transformative kingdom, could Christianity sell its genius for the tools of violence. And that is exactly what happened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By trading in their eschatology, they traded in the kingdom, and took the bait of Christendom.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2004/08/29/free-coffee-in-dayton-oh-82804/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2004/08/29/free-coffee-in-dayton-oh-82804/</link><pubDate>Sun Aug 29 02:29:00 CDT 2004</pubDate><title>Free Coffee in Dayton, OH - 8/28/04</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>8/25/04 - The Redding Brothers will be returning to Dayton this weekend for a special concert at the A Coffee Affair shop at 4 West Franklin Street.

Ac...</description><content:encoded>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;In my previous essay, &lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/the-resurrection-is-technological"&gt;The Resurrection is Technological&lt;/a&gt;, I explored Paul’s argument in 1 Corinthians 15, that the resurrection is about God’s intention for humanity to reign over the cosmos. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Paul, God’s plan was for humans to rule the universe, and if humans failed to do so, God would not abandon his plan, but would &lt;em&gt;become human&lt;/em&gt; to insure its completion. This is the reason for the incarnation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Paul, Death is the ultimate obstacle to humanity's God-intended reign. And because God had ordained for humanity to reign over the universe, humanity would have to defeat death. This is the reason for the resurrection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus, as Paul sees it, the resurrection is not simply an isolated future event. It is virtually synonymous with the unfolding reign of Christ, stretching from Christ’s own individual resurrection, up through the final defeat of death itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;For he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet. The last enemy to be destroyed is death. (1 Corinthians 15:24-26)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the previous essay, I emphasized that this reign is &lt;em&gt;participatory&lt;/em&gt;. Christ does not come to remove humanity’s God-ordained reign, but to restore it, embody it, and invite us into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;…if we endure, we will also reign with him. (2 Timothy 2:12)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the whole point of the New Testament. Christ never intended to reign alone. Christ’s triumph was in “bringing many sons and daughters to glory” (Hebrews 2:10). Christ’s glory is that others will be transformed to be like him (Romans 8:29). Christ’s reign is a reign we are called to participate in at all levels, even up to and including the apocalypse itself (1 Corinthians 6:3; Revelation 2:26-27; Revelation 20:4).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Don’t you know that we will judge angels?”, Paul exclaims in 1 Corinthians 6:3. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This participatory reign of Christ wasn’t merely metaphorical. Paul expected his hearers to reign over cosmic beings, and they needed to be practicing for the occasion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And indeed, resurrection is something Christ invites his followers to practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse those who have leprosy, drive out demons. Freely you have received; freely give. (Matthew 10:8)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jesus raised several people from the dead in his ministry, and so did his disciples. But Jesus anticipated that this would be even more dramatic in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Very truly I tell you, whoever believes in me will do the works I have been doing, and they will do even greater things than these, because I am going to the Father. (John 14:12)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;So this is not something we wait around to do. This is something we participate in now, to the extent of our capabilities and gifts. We do it in healing, in caring, in feeding, in blessing. We do it in fighting for someone’s life, in searching for a cure, in seeking to understand the nature of life and death and disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We do it in remembering and celebrating and grieving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why must we play a part in this? Why can’t we simply wait for God to raise the dead, and set everything to rights? Why must we fight for our loved ones, and not simply wait for God to return them to us?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand that, we need to understand why death is so bad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Death is a Tragedy that Compounds&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Death is a tragedy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone who tells you otherwise has either not experienced it up close and personally, or is trying to find a way of coming to terms with just how bad it is. It is a tragedy, not simply because someone is gone, but because all the relationships they were part of have now come to a halt. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is the value of life, if not this? What is it we struggle for, fight for, and remember about someone, if not their relationships? What do we live to do?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We live to &lt;em&gt;be in relationship&lt;/em&gt;—with people, animals, our bodies, the physical world. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of us want long, healthy, productive and meaningful lives. We want to contribute to others in our community, our society, our family. We want to create new things, and fix old things. We want to share joy and jokes and stories with other people, who will then share joy and jokes and stories with us. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Relationships, in the deepest sense, are who we are. We are not atomic, isolated, Cartesian minds—we are deeply intertwined networks of relationships, stretching out to the ends of the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Death takes all of this away. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Christians trust that the dead &lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/all-are-alive"&gt;still exist in some way&lt;/a&gt;, and will exist in an even more robust way in the future. Many Christians don't even think there is any subjective time between death, and the ultimate future that is waiting for us. Our loved ones may fall asleep, and wake up in a glorious world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This might tempt us to think that death is no big deal. If death can be overcome, why mourn it at all? Why not rejoice in our loved one's short-cut into glorious life?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This misses something significant. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Death is a tragedy that compounds.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Relationships compound. The experience you had with someone twenty years ago forms the bedrock of your experience today. If you lived or worked with someone for any significant amount of time, the relationship at the end of that process is inescapably unique. There's no way to "make up for lost time" in a relationship—the relationship is simply different than it would have been otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So when someone dies, all the relationships they would have been part of are irrevocably changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All the lives they could have touched, good they could have done, grandchildren they could have seen, enemies they could have reconciled with, memories they could have made, conversations they could have had…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of this is gone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That loss grows with each passing day, impacting vast numbers of people, draining increasing amounts of potential good from the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s no obvious way to make up for not having a parent growing up, or not having your partner through the most exciting years of your life. There’s no way to make up for missing hundreds of conversations with your dad or your mom—or your sister, brother, or child. All of that has simply disappeared, and you grow into a different person than you would have been.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s no way to go back. This means that:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Death never ceases to be a tragedy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if someone is resurrected, we will have lost immeasurable opportunities in between. Even in bringing someone back, we may never catch up with the positive impact they could have had.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If God were to resurrect everyone today, it would be a wonderful, amazing thing. It would be an incredible blessing. But it would not make up for the opportunities and relationships we have missed out on. It would not make up for what we have lost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So if the real tragedy of death is to be overcome, perhaps there is something else that has to happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why the Resurrection Demands Participation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;What could possibly make up for irreversible loss?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only thing I can imagine making up for the loss of relationship—is if that loss catalyzed us to become capable of deeper, broader, and fuller relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If loss gave us the opportunity to develop a deeper and fuller capacity for love than we could offer otherwise, then our reunion with our loved ones might not simply allow us to pick up where we left off, but might allow us to rejoin them in a much more profound way. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To put it in crude, numeric terms, imagine becoming capable of offering 1,000 years worth of relationship in the space of a year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How might loss provide us with that opportunity? What might happen in the wake of a loss, that would help us grow in this way?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I want to suggest that it is our very commitment to participate in the resurrection—our commitment to grieve, heal, renew, work, and hope—that provides us with the opportunity to grow into the kind of people who can love in a much deeper and fuller form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;After all, this is exactly what Christianity suggests: we must be conformed to the image of Christ. In some form or fashion, we must die and be raised. And in some form or fashion, we must raise the dead.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only in becoming the image of Christ, can we grow into the fullness of what we are intended to be. Only in becoming the image of Christ, can our love become like God’s love, reaching out to encompass the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And only that kind of capacity for love can make up for the irreversible tragedy that is death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How we Participate in the Resurrection of the Dead&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve been suggesting that biblically, defeating death is a process that is virtually synonymous with the unfolding reign of Christ. It’s something we participate in in all kinds of ways, and no aspect of human life is left out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everything from eating soup, to photographing the cosmos, ultimately plays a part, becoming an aspect of our living sacrifice. Every time we choose good over evil, or mercy over judgment, we are playing a role in the resurrection of the dead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if the tragedy of death is to be overcome, there must be specific things that only happen in the wake of someone’s death. There must be specific things that happen when we lose someone—things that help us grow in the ways we’ve been talking about, and help us strengthen our relationship with the person we’ve lost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first one, of course, is grief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Blessed are those who mourn&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Blessed are those who mourn…” (Matthew 5:4)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This verse used to perplex me. Why is it good to mourn? Are we supposed to be wishing for bad things to happen? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having experienced a number of tragedies, I now realize that the answer is no. Bad things have &lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt; happened—the only question is how we are to respond. In the face of tragedy, we face two temptations: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;To decide that life is not worth living, that nothing matters, that all is lost, to resign ourselves to nothingness, and embrace unconscious nihilism. Or,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;To insist that everything is okay, that nothing is as bad as it seems, that this is “just the natural order”, that “everything is for the best”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both of these are ways of rejecting reality. One refuses to live in a reality this tragic, the other refuses to believe that reality is as tragic as it actually is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grief refuses to accept either of these answers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The one who mourns is the one who sees the evil that has happened, and rather than drawing back from it, or pretending it’s alright—recognizes it for the horror it really is. And thus, they mourn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grief is the simultaneous recognition of the world as it is, and the world as it should be—and the recognition that these are not the same. Grief will bear no trite comfort, no “it’s for the best”, no “this is just the natural order”. Grief is the intense and insistent embrace of reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we grieve, we hold together two impossible things: a love for the world, and a refusal to be okay with its horror. Grief exercises the ultimate existential muscle, helping us become stronger and more expansive, capable of experiencing deeper feeling and love—allowing us to share in God’s own perspective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grief is the heart of change. Grief is the soul of revolution. Grief provokes action—if the world is not as it should be, we must change the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blessed are those who mourn, because those who mourn can be comforted. And those who grieve can be filled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world as it is, and the world as it should be, are poles apart. The ones who see this, and rather than accepting it, choose to participate in the solution—must always mourn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Weep with those who weep&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the wake of tragedy, families and communities often come together. Relationships are strengthened around the loss they have experienced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Relatives who have not talked in years may reunite, friends from different parts of the deceased’s life may connect. People who offer to help out may find themselves drawn into deep relationships with people they might not otherwise have ever talked to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We may discover deep reserves in our friends and family that we never knew were there. We may discover new things about ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In all of this—in grieving someone, and in strengthening our relationships in their absence—we are creating a stronger and more definite relationship with the person we have lost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In grief, we focus our thoughts and memories, we take stock of a person's impact on the world, we realize they reached far beyond what we might assume. We collect and retell stories about them, we assess and evaluate their impact, we bring together different aspects of their life into a more cohesive picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We may find ourselves doing things that appear irrational. We may keep things that belonged to them, we may find ways to integrate them into new traditions and experiences, we may talk about what they would have wanted, we may visit their grave and speak to them about what is going on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much of this may not make sense, under the assumption that the deceased person is truly gone. But if we believe that the person still exists in some way, and will exist in a more robust way in the future—then we are still in a relationship with them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And these things are our way of maintaining and strengthening that relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Hope &amp;amp; Act&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In John’s account of the resurrection of Lazarus, Jesus goes through each of these steps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He weeps, expressing deep grief over the loss that has occurred.&lt;br/&gt;He connects with the family and community, strengthening their relationship.&lt;br/&gt;He remembers, strengthening his relationship with Lazarus himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a moving part of the account, Jesus speaks with Lazarus’ sister Martha, asking her if she believes that Lazarus can be raised. &lt;em&gt;I know he will be raised at the end of time&lt;/em&gt;, she responds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Jesus is not content with this. He wants Martha to see that the resurrection is not just something that happens eventually. The resurrection is already at work. It is in their midst. It is standing right in front of her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Martha sees. And when she does, she has the stone rolled away. And then Jesus calls Lazarus to come out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We might think that if Jesus could call forth Lazarus, that he could handle the stone. We might think that Jesus could have skipped the conversation, and just compelled Martha’s faith by moving straight to Lazarus’ resurrection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this is not how Jesus works. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even in this extreme case, the resurrection is participatory. Martha must have faith that the resurrection is already at work. Then she must take the initiative to roll back the stone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only then can her voice join with Jesus, calling Lazarus to come forth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the biblical story, God insists on performing the resurrection through humanity—even becoming human in Christ, in order to insure that this is how it would be accomplished. And according to the scriptures, Christ, as the ultimate human, has been given all power and authority to bring the resurrection about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And yet, he does not do so immediately. The earliest Christians assumed that the ultimate resurrection would come soon, but they did not expect it to be immediate. Paul portrays the resurrection as an unfolding process, in which Christ subdues his enemies gradually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why? What is he waiting for?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps he is waiting for &lt;em&gt;us&lt;/em&gt;. Perhaps participation is intrinsic to the process in a deeper way than we typically think. Perhaps this is shouted from the pages of the New Testament—and we haven’t been paying attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps only by grieving, weeping, comforting, remembering, trusting, and acting can we truly become the image of Christ—the kind of people we need to be, in order for the tragedy of death to be overcome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After all, anything less would fall short of the Glory of Christ—because in Christ, &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; is participatory.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/02/10/deus-ex-machina/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/02/10/deus-ex-machina/</link><pubDate>Fri Feb 10 10:08:15 CST 2012</pubDate><title>Deus Ex Machina</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>In [Insurrection](http://peterrollins.net/?page_id=3440), Peter Rollins critiques the *[Deus Ex Machina](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deus_ex_machina)*.

It's a terrible contrivance, and we've probably all seen bad movies that make use of just this sort of device. Perhaps it comes in the form of a fairy godmother, or someone winning the lottery, or someone waking up to discover that the whole episode was a dream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What makes this so abhorrent is that it invalidates everything else in the story. We are tracking along with the characters, experiencing their desires and struggles, watching everything run on a collision course towards the center. We hold our breath, waiting to see what will happen. And then the stagemaster cranks in his cheesy plot device. The story has just been destroyed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's worse because we know we can't rely on such devices in our lives. If we get late on our bills, we can't just win the lottery, or whisk in a fairy godmother. We actually have to struggle through the issues, solving problems by weaving together the strands of our desires and abilities and choices. In investing ourselves in a story, we are trusting that the author will do the same thing, working with the same threads we have, and in the process, showing us a way forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem isn't with the supernatural itself. We enjoy movies about wizards and vampires and superheroes. But when those stories are done well, the supernatural isn't the mechanism by which problems are solved - it's the mechanism that causes the problems in the first place. If Harry Potter could have simply cast a spell and solved all his problems, there would have been no story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peter Rollins suggests that all religion promotes the Deus Ex Machina. Whether extreme fundamentalism or feel-good Christianity, religion trots out a God who appears whenever we need reassurance, confidence, or purpose in life, and who otherwise gets cranked back up into the rafters. Rather than doing the hard work of finding true meaning in our existence, we can rely on this much easier and more convenient fallback mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This dynamic works itself out in the church. Once a week, we are offered the chance to step into an alternate world and &lt;em&gt;truly experience&lt;/em&gt; the presence of God, in a &lt;em&gt;thin space&lt;/em&gt; which operates to free us from &lt;em&gt;the cares of this life&lt;/em&gt;. But if this effort is successful, we may well end up addicted to ever-more ecstatic worship experiences. The more successful we are at &lt;em&gt;bringing God near&lt;/em&gt; in these unique moments, the more the color and meaning is drained from the rest of our lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've detailed this &lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/2011/12/25/peter-rollins-and-experiencing-god"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. A God standing outside our world will always draw us away from normal life, sucking the meaning right out of existence and into a world far removed from our own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rollins' solution to this, and one that I endorse as wholly biblical, is that we must come to see God not in some external reality, but as being present in the very act of love. Rather than an object of affection, God becomes the means by which we love others. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there is a problem. Many of the people who embrace this approach are unable to see how God could then be &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; in any sense. God becomes a personification of love, and loses all substance. &lt;a href="http://experimentaltheology.blogspot.com/2012/02/insurrection-critique.html"&gt;Richard Beck has suggested&lt;/a&gt; that while this &lt;em&gt;losing God, finding love&lt;/em&gt; thing might have some validity, it might also cause you to commit suicide. Instead of making a choice between a transcendent God and a God present in love, couldn't we have both? Or as Daniel Kirk says, &lt;a href="http://www.jrdkirk.com/2011/12/23/insurrection-pt-1/"&gt;maybe it's not either-or, maybe it's both-and&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a very common refrain among postmodernists, and it's one I inherently distrust. It seems to me that if there are legimitate tensions between two ideas, we shouldn't just go smacking those ideas together and calling it good. There is a reason for the tension, and it demands that we figure out why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But I, for one, do believe in a real God. And I also think Pete is right to suggest that focusing on a metaphysical world devalues life. And I &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; think Richard is correct to point out that simply abandoning your ground of being is a good way to end up killing yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what alternatives are there? Is there a way to believe in a real God, and yet not get sucked into the metaphysical trap? Is there a way to affirm God as being present in love, and yet not lose God as &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think there is a way, and one that seems to have remained relatively unexplored. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rollins places God firmly in the actual mechanics of our love towards others. In the biblical narrative, we can say this is true because God placed himself there. God, desiring to draw us into the world, made it so that our affection for him always has to go through something else. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is as if he placed the entire world between us and him, and said "Now love me!" And so our love, as a result, has to hit everything in between. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this is not the entirety of our experience of God, because God loves us back. And so God's love comes to us, back through the world, humanity, and the rest of reality. This experience of love can never be entirely localized or constrained, because it comes to us from all directions, an omnipresent downpour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This draws us firmly into the world, because we cannot love God without loving the world. But neither can we experience God's love apart from our experience of the world. That love can never be reduced to a specific entity or location, but is always experienced &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt; specific entities and locations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;God is real because love comes to us. God is experienced when we direct that love towards others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is what saves our love from becoming idolatry. This is what saves God from becoming a flattened abstraction of our own sentiments. This is what gives us an alternative to metaphysical obsession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And this is how God comes to us not as the &lt;em&gt;Deus Ex Machina&lt;/em&gt;, but as the very dynamic of the play itself.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2008/02/23/the-moment-is-perfect/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2008/02/23/the-moment-is-perfect/</link><pubDate>Sat Feb 23 08:47:00 CST 2008</pubDate><title>The moment is perfect</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>One night this past Fall, it was a bit warm in my bedroom.

Outside, though, the temperature was just perfect. So I pushed open the window and lay in bed with the perfectly tuned breeze wafting through the room, carrying scent-notes of late Summer and outdoor plant life. The sounds were relaxing and rhythmic. Everything was ideal. To me, lying in bed with that breeze and those sounds was the perfect experience. Maybe it reminded me of Summer growing up, I don't know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At one point, I began to think about shutting the window, so I wouldn't have to get up and do it later. I can experience this tomorrow night, I thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But another part of me clung to the experience, thought better of it, and let the window stay open. That night turned out to be the one and only night like that this past year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it occured to me to write this down, I thought of waiting until tomorrow. Then I thought again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The moment is what we have. Experience it fully.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2011/12/23/imputed-righteousness-part-2/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2011/12/23/imputed-righteousness-part-2/</link><pubDate>Fri Dec 23 16:02:04 CST 2011</pubDate><title>imputed righteousness, part 2</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>I've [just written](http://micahredding.com/blog/2011/12/19/imputed-righteousness-and-switching-tracks) how reading Paul's statements on guilt changed my whole way of thinking, and switched my mind to...</description><content:encoded>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I've &lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/2011/12/19/imputed-righteousness-and-switching-tracks"&gt;just written&lt;/a&gt; how reading Paul's statements on guilt changed my whole way of thinking, and switched my mind to a new track.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The track I'm referring to is something I've called "non-metaphysical Christianity", the idea that the scriptures are not talking about invisible scoreboards and diagrams, but about real changes in the minds and emotions of human beings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means reinterpreting theological terms like salvation, sanctification, and purification to refer to actual changes in human life, and not just changes we experience at church. It means reinterpeting big ideas like the trinity and &lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/2009/12/13/jesus-is-lord"&gt;"Jesus is Lord"&lt;/a&gt;, rediscovering them as experiential realities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anything else is suspect; once our discussion is cut loose from real human life, there is nothing to keep us from floating into abstract theological worlds of pure nonsense - where most of the religious world is now. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be clear, I'm not denying metaphysical realities, or scoreboards in the sky. I'm denying that we can say anything meaningful about them, unless they have specific implications in concrete reality. I'm denying that theology should be about angels on pinheads. I'm doing the same thing for theology that the scientific method does for physics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the only respectful posture we can take. If God is a reality, he is a reality far more complex than even our most elevated understandings. There is no hope that we can size him up in some simple terms. There is no sense in which our theological concepts grasp his real essence. Instead, we can understand that these terms were given to us to help us process our experience and relationship with the reality beyond reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this, I'm just following in the footsteps of the first Christians. They were very blunt, quick to throw out any theology that wasn't concrete. According to them, the temple was just a building, sacrifices didn't really do anything about sin, and religious services were probably keeping you from doing something worthwhile, like helping mugging victims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their blatant honesty was the groundwork for the new spirituality they experienced. Beyond all the religious ideas, beyond the show and ceremony, they had to confront the realities of human life. That was where God was found, drinking wine and eating bread, dying on a cross in the dark.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2006/06/09/drinking-only-water-2/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2006/06/09/drinking-only-water-2/</link><pubDate>Fri Jun 09 19:14:00 CDT 2006</pubDate><title>Drinking only water</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>About three weeks ago, Josiah, Gabe, and I decided to stop drinking soda, milk, juice, etc, and start drinking only water.

My thoughts were that I was tired of waking up exhausted and having to drink caffeine to get through the day, only to feel even worse afterwards. I figured that if I was waking up exhausted, I needed to focus on getting enough sleep the night before, and I suspected that if I drank enough water, I wouldn't need caffeine, and might feel even better. So Gabe pressured us to make a pact to drink only water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a result, I inadvertently lost 15 pounds in three weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And all without counting calories, dieting, or ceasing from eating junk food at the local convenience store. And losing weight really wasn't on my immediate "to-do list" either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are several things that have struck me since deciding to do this. One is that I had the habit of getting hungry, and then dealing with my hunger by drinking soda. Even eating a candy bar probably has less calories and more nutrition than soda. And when you drink something, it may make you full for a while, but you'll soon be just as hungry. Replacing meals with sugar-water is a bad idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not a calorie issue either. I would often drink diet soda; it too is filling, but leaves you feeling even more hungry than regular soda. So it tends to cause over-eating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other thing that struck me is how water tends to fix your ailments. I haven't really done much better on getting sleep; I've made a lot of trips lately where I'm getting in at 3:30am and getting up at 7:00am. But when I drink a lot of water, it makes me feel more alert than caffeinated soda does. And in general, it just seems like I've felt better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This wasn't the easiest decision for me to make. Just like Gabe, I tend to drink ALL the time. I have to drink or chew on something. And my ideal situation would be to not ever have to eat and just be able to drink smoothies all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But there is something philosophical to be said about eating when you're hungry, drinking when you're thirsty, and not screwing that equation up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Water is THE drink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-micah&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2007/03/16/the-taming-of-the-world-why-america-is-not-a-modern-rome/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2007/03/16/the-taming-of-the-world-why-america-is-not-a-modern-rome/</link><pubDate>Fri Mar 16 23:45:00 CDT 2007</pubDate><title>The Taming of the World - Why America is not a Modern Rome</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>I was considering today how much God has changed the world.Consider the fact that today we have a significant minority of people who feel that capital punishment is WRONG, and feel strongly about it. ...</description><content:encoded>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I was considering today how much God has changed the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Consider the fact that today we have a significant minority of people who feel that capital punishment is WRONG, and feel strongly about it. Further, the majority of people in America feel that capital punishment should only be used in the most extreme cases. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where did people get the idea that convicted killers, rapists, and thieves should be shown mercy?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people have lamented that America is becoming a modern Rome. But did Rome have people gathering around crucifixion sites to protest? Weren't they instead gathering around to enjoy the spectacle? To join in the fun of torturing others?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn't matter how you feel about capital punishment. This shows a remarkable change; an enormous increase in human empathy, even if it is misdirected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also isn't saying that America or the rest of the modern world is perfect. We still have our spectacles; we still enjoy the downfall of others. But we're changing, very slowly, but surely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It appears to me that since Jesus, God has begun to rule in a different way, from the bottom up, slowly changing people and society.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Could Jesus have been alluding to this when he used growth metaphors in describing the kingdom of God? When he compared the kingdom to yeast?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-micah&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2006/12/14/how-do-you-pronounce-in-excelsis-deo/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2006/12/14/how-do-you-pronounce-in-excelsis-deo/</link><pubDate>Thu Dec 14 20:36:00 CST 2006</pubDate><title>How do YOU pronounce In Excelsis Deo?</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>Imagine this: you're standing around a warm fireplace on Christmas Eve, bundled up in a woolen sweater, with some after-Christmas-feast eggnog in your mittened paws.

Aunt Ruth kindly points out that everyone in the extended family would LOVE to sing some Christmas Carols, so some brave soul rallies the troops from all corners of the house, and strikes up the immortal Christmas anthem: "Angels We Have Heard on High".&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the family screeches through the extended "Glooooooooooo-ooo-ooo-ria!" section, and rounds the bends towards the "&lt;b&gt;In Excelsis Deo&lt;/b&gt;", the carol dissembles into meaninglessness. Aunt Ruth screeches "In Egg-Shell-Sheesh Deo!", Cousin Sam warbles "An Ex-Celtic Duo!", while Uncle Bud bellows "I'll Egg Chelsea's Daewoo!"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"In Excelsis Deo" - I have heard all kinds of pronounciations for this Christmas-time staple. And every year, thousands of families across America launch into spirited debates about the pronounciation of this Latin phrase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay...maybe that's just &lt;i&gt;my&lt;/i&gt; family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be that as it may, I was tired of getting into ceaseless debates with relatives about the matter during the Christmas Holiday Season. So I decided I needed to turn to an authority on this matter -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the internet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started to do some research. Here are some different opinions:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;"There is a third pronunciation - 'ExSHELsis' that is supposedly more correct." &lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;"There is a 'common Latin' vs. a 'classical Latin'. While nobody knows how classical Latin was really pronounced, centuries of verbal tradition in the Catholic church and in church music favors the 'ch' or the 'sh' over the 'soft c' version of 'excel'."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;"I am not interested in &lt;a href="http://www.mindspring.com/%7Ebrucec/hypatia.htm"&gt;Catholic tradition&lt;/a&gt;, or how near 2000 years of church choirs might have corrupted the pronunciation. All it would take is one person with a speech impediment, whose identity is lost in antiquity, to permanently corrupt pronunciation of a language only seldom used."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well! It looks like nobody really knows how to pronounce it. But I wasn't ready to give up, so I headed for &lt;a href="http://www.melop.net/phlatina/sentence.html"&gt;Phonetica Latin&lt;/a&gt;, the apparent self-proclaimed authority on how to pronounce Latin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I was not to be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actually, I was to be disappointed. Because it turns out that they have all kinds of different ways to do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately, all was not lost. They did link to this &lt;a href="http://www.melop.net/phlatina/pron/Gloria_in_excelsis.mp3"&gt;VERY ANNOYING clip&lt;/a&gt; of the Vienna Boys Choir singing the song, and at least THEY agree with &lt;a href="http://www.reddingbrothers.com/stream/mp3/snow/angels.mp3"&gt;MY pronounciation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vindication at last!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Listen to my take on this song at my &lt;a href="http://www.myspace.com/reddingbrothers"&gt;myspace page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-micah redding&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.micahredding.com/"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.micahredding.com"&gt;http://www.micahredding.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="tags"&gt;technorati tags: &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/Christmas" rel="tag"&gt;Christmas&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/Carol" rel="tag"&gt;Carol&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/Carols" rel="tag"&gt;Carols&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/Christmas+Carol" rel="tag"&gt;Christmas Carol&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/Christmas+Carols" rel="tag"&gt;Christmas Carols&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/Angels+We+Have+Heard+On+High" rel="tag"&gt;Angels We Have Heard On High&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/Rock+Christmas" rel="tag"&gt;Rock Christmas&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/Rock+Carols" rel="tag"&gt;Rock Carols&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/Rock+Band" rel="tag"&gt;Rock Band&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/Rock+Music" rel="tag"&gt;Rock Music&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2008/02/07/finally-legal/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2008/02/07/finally-legal/</link><pubDate>Thu Feb 07 17:39:00 CST 2008</pubDate><title>Finally Legal</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>For the first time in years, I'm actually a legitimate resident of a state.

That state happens to be Tennessee.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;For the entire time I was living in WV, I had a Washington State driver's license. Once I had moved to Tennessee (with WV plates and a Washington driver's license) and had lived here for awhile, I decided to update to a a WV drivers license.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So I went back to WV (where I still had some mail and residency documents), and got my license. Only trouble was, they accidentally gave me a learner's permit. And I didn't realize this until 2 weeks later, back in Tennessee, when someone asked me to see it.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So I drove back to WV, got my license upgraded to a real WV &lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style:italic;"&gt;Driver's&lt;/span&gt; License, and everything was fine. Except they got my birthdate wrong. But I let that slide.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So here I am living in Tennessee with WV plates and a WV driver's license. Finally, my WV plates expired, and I decided to get Tennessee plates. So for the last year, I've been driving around with Tennessee plates and a WV driver's license.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Today, I finally went legit. I went and renewed my tags, and applied for (and received!) a Tennessee Driver's License! I may have accidentally perjured myself in the process, but I did receive it.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So for the first time in years, all my documents are from one state. And that state happens to be the one I'm actually living in.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;It's a monumental occasion, and I just thought you should know about it.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2014/09/14/politics-metaphysics/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2014/09/14/politics-metaphysics/</link><pubDate>Sun Sep 14 22:46:44 CDT 2014</pubDate><title>Politics is Metaphysics</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>I watched Atlas Shrugged last night.

Nevertheless, it was thought-provoking in several ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One might be forgiven for thinking that this movie was about politics. The cameo appearances from political pundits, the focus on government, regulation, and industry, the people who seemed to have supported its creation — all would seem to suggest that this is primarily a piece of political propaganda. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it’s not. It’s metaphysical propaganda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The core argument of the story — poorly told as it was — is that the essence of mankind is creative work. Further, that creative work can only happen when a person is completely free, and the best way to cultivate creative work is to focus entirely on your own self-interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That last bit is the part I’m most skeptical about, but we’ll come back to that. The main point — that mankind is, in essence, the &lt;em&gt;creative worker&lt;/em&gt; — is a metaphysical claim, and all the politics in the story are really peripheral to it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It occurs to me that this may be the case with most politics. Most political stories we see are not really about the mechanics of government or the legal system. Most of them are simply proxies for bigger questions that people are already fighting over. And many of these bigger questions ultimately connect up to subjects that border on the metaphysical: &lt;em&gt;Are humans intrinsically good, socialized towards evil? Or are humans intrinsically evil, socialized towards good?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve fought over these ideas for eons, and are still fighting them today. Only our expressions change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think about this kind of thing when I overhear political arguments that seem overblown or irrelevant to me. I remind myself: &lt;em&gt;these people aren’t fighting about politics, they’re fighting about what it means to be human&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And given the significance of that subject — to everything from our understanding of the cosmos, to an individual’s ability to get through the workday — I’m not surprised they fight.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2004/11/26/new-photos-new-website-in-case-you-hadnt-noticed/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2004/11/26/new-photos-new-website-in-case-you-hadnt-noticed/</link><pubDate>Fri Nov 26 03:59:00 CST 2004</pubDate><title>New Photos &amp; New Website (in case you hadn&amp;#039;t noticed)</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>We've just posted some new photos on our photos page (imagine that).

(Did you notice me slip the word "eschew" in there casually?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason for this is obvious. If Britney Spears came out as a Democrat, she'd start getting a lot of flack and bad publicity. If she came out as a Republican, it'd be worse. Either way, she'd hurt her career. Why? Because she'd be making people focus on things that matter, and making them take sides. As it is, people can turn off the "beliefs and opinions" section of their brains, and totally focus on the entertainment aspect of Britney. It's the only way she can survive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But a lot of this has also been at the pressure of the media. Talk show hosts and politicians sarcastically ask why we should pay attention to entertainers' political beliefs. What are their qualifications, after all?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(We might well ask politicians what &lt;span style="font-style:italic;"&gt;their&lt;/span&gt; qualifications are, but that's another story.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it makes sense. Britney Spears knows no more about politics than any other average Joe on the street. She probably knows less. If she started talking about it, she'd probably say some hugely embarrassing things. The same applies to most other pop stars out there. The political statements from them that do manage to slip through are showcases of the ridiculous naivety Americans are known for. They remind me of Anakin Skywalker's take on politics as expressed in Star Wars: Episode Two. He was telling Padme how he just wished that government could do what was good for everyone. And if they didn't know what was good for everyone, they should get a big group of people together, and decide. Her response? That is &lt;span style="font-style:italic;"&gt;exactly&lt;/span&gt; what they do!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But just because pop stars aren't suited to discoursing on things other than themselves does not mean that musicians in general shouldn't. In fact, I think one of the problems is that the only musicians who do speak out are espousing another "business-as-usual" political party. The ones with reasonable, logical views keep their mouths closed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After all, why BE a musician, if not to express my thoughts and feelings to the world? I certainly didn't start this for the quick money. And, even if I do say so myself, I think that my thoughts and opinions are actually reasonable, logical, considered, and consistent. I'm not out here spouting off about "cute bunnies and the need for political reform".&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I'll say something right here. I don't think that either of the two main political parties in America have it together. A lot of musicians who DO have opinions tout the Democrats as their party of choice. So does MTV and Rock The Vote. In doing so, they think they are espousing the revolutionary tendencies that rock &amp;amp; roll is known for. But despite their attempt to portray an image of compassion, the Democrats are just as corrupt, just as pandering, just as dishonest, just as war-mongering, just as poor-hating, just as racist, and just as political as the next party.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These people are selling out their musical predecessors' ideals. Bob Dylan stood up and refused to be claimed by the socialists of his time. Musicians should wake up and refuse to be claimed by either political party.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Music should stand as a reforming, revolutionary force that puts a check on the blatant materialism and and soul-lessness that politics is known for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-micah&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2006/06/09/clouds-2/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2006/06/09/clouds-2/</link><pubDate>Fri Jun 09 18:29:00 CDT 2006</pubDate><title>clouds</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>Stream The SongRead The StoryClouds (w:m micah redding)A long time ago, a nation very far awayYoung men stood on a hillside, dreaming of another dayThey never knew what this would lead to, all these v...</description><content:encoded>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.reddingbrothers.com/sound/stream/clouds.m3u"&gt;Stream The Song&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://thereddingbrothers.blogspot.com/2006/05/clouds-song.html"&gt;Read The Story&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Clouds (w:m micah redding)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A long time ago, a nation very far away&lt;br /&gt;Young men stood on a hillside, dreaming of another day&lt;br /&gt;They never knew what this would lead to, all these visions, all these things&lt;br /&gt;All they knew was that they'd never lose the power of the dream&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And now a thousand years later, and a million miles since&lt;br /&gt;You can still hear them coming, hear their voices in the wind, they're singing&lt;br /&gt;A million different cities where the people cried aloud&lt;br /&gt;You could hear the changes coming in the clouds&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;[It came in the clouds that day&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Blowing open heaven's gates&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Coming in on the winds of change&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;The day it all came down&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;That day was filled with clouds]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They saw a new heaven and earth, a new birth, new universe, born right here on the earth&lt;br /&gt;They knew that if this was to happen everything would have to change&lt;br /&gt;They'd bring the revolution and the day&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;[chorus]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The change they knew was coming never took them by surprise&lt;br /&gt;But lifted them unspoken with the winds into the skies&lt;br /&gt;And now you can hear their voices, all eternity they cry&lt;br /&gt;Immortal they're a beacon in the sky&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;[chorus]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2005/08/26/writers-showcase-lineup-2/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2005/08/26/writers-showcase-lineup-2/</link><pubDate>Fri Aug 26 14:48:00 CDT 2005</pubDate><title>Writers Showcase Lineup</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>Brian White is a staff writer for BMG / Brentwood Benson.

He has 10 number one songs to his credit in the Christian Market and is a 2 time Dove Award winner. Currently has songs in the country market on albums by Trace Adkins "Rough and Ready" , Neal McCoy "Tailgate" and Blackhawk "Brighter". A frequent singer and speaker at conferences across the U.S. Has had over 300 cuts in his writing career.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rob Blackledge&lt;/strong&gt;: When it comes down to it, Rob Blackledge lives for one thing...Polo Rosa Marie. That's right. Italian food. Not to mention his love for motorcylces and kites, Rob is one of the most well rounded and talented musicians to hit Nashville since...welll, the last guy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tres Crow&lt;/strong&gt; hails from Michigan but recently has made Nashville his home. He has been writing songs for ten years and counts The Beatles, The Beach Boys, and Broken Social Scene three of his most influential bands. He is new to town and is looking to form a band so if you play guitar, bass, drums, or keyboards then contact him at &lt;a href="mailto:&amp;#x74;&amp;#x72;esc&amp;#x72;&amp;#x6f;&amp;#119;@&amp;#121;&amp;#x61;&amp;#104;&amp;#111;&amp;#x6f;.&amp;#99;&amp;#111;&amp;#x6d;&amp;#x2e;"&gt;&amp;#x74;&amp;#x72;esc&amp;#x72;&amp;#x6f;&amp;#119;@&amp;#121;&amp;#x61;&amp;#104;&amp;#111;&amp;#x6f;.&amp;#99;&amp;#111;&amp;#x6d;&amp;#x2e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shelley Raymond&lt;/strong&gt;'s free and fearless vocals range from a cooing whisper to a soulful, plaintiff howl. Her lyrics tear you apart line by line, only to build you back again with verse after verse of surgically precise digs and strokes. Raymond casually combines elements of soul and folk into something she playfully refers to as "soulk music" (which, afterall, sounds better than "foul music"). Whatever she calls it, it's not your average girl-with-a-guitar fare and deserves your undivided ear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gentry Morris&lt;/strong&gt;: Ok so here is my bio...I am a pretty ordinary guy by most accounts. I grew up in Georgia listening to my dads old Creedance Clearwater Revival and James Taylor records and until I was about 13 I had absolutely no idea that there was any other music besides this...yes...I was sheltered. When I started playing guitar it was because I was a skinny little white kid and the girls didn't like me...football was out...so i figured...maybe if I played guitar. Yeah...no artsy, I wanna change the way things work reasons...it was all for the chicks. Really that's what it comes down to for most musicians whether they want to admit it or not. Well the girls still didn't like me...sad day...so I started writing songs about it and then it began...no...no...no...not the girls liking me...the songwriting thing. So here I am today living in Nashville Tennessee trying to convince people to listen to my music and give me money for CD's. My music is a "montage" (my word of the day) of those old classics my dad had, mixed with some more recent influences. People say I sound like John Mayer and Jason Mraz alot...I dont really see it that much but its cool if they do. Another one of my friends said I sound like and American version of Travis...which is really cool cause those guys rock! Anyway...I like my music...its not meant to be artsy or techincally difficult with secret meanings and all that jazz. It is meant to be simple... catchy...songs that will get stuck in your head...songs for first dates or last dates...songs for sunny days lying on your back in a park or rainy days driving in your car...they are singing in the shower songs...thats what I do...I make the songs you sing in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mayflye&lt;/strong&gt; are an acoustic rock quartet based in Murfreesboro, TN. Comprised of four regular guys with day jobs and cell-phone bills, Mayflye spend their free time writing melodic rock songs with a verve that is often unseen in the contemporary acoustic genre today. Initially founded by fellow MTSU alumni, Gregory Castillo, Matt Frasher, and John Sorrels began writing songs together on the bottom floor of a poorly ventilated Murfreesboro apartment complex in early 2004. Later that spring and in need of a bassist, they joined forces with perhaps the most unlikely of characters, David Castro, a Columbian refugee with little to no experience as a bass player. In a brilliant display of confidence, David picked up the bass and earned his way into the band, dazzling its members with his obvious knack for melody and rhythmic poise. Since then, Mayflye have been determined to further their abilities and broaden their musical tact by flirting with a variety of new styles and even new instruments. So, is it possible that you will see a Mayflye post-hardcore polka-funk album in the near future? You never know. You just might.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2016/02/17/why-christians-should-support-radical-life-extension/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2016/02/17/why-christians-should-support-radical-life-extension/</link><pubDate>Wed Feb 17 10:09:47 CST 2016</pubDate><title>Why Christians Should Support Radical Life Extension</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>“Never again will there be…

...</description><content:encoded>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;“Never again will there be…&lt;br/&gt;an infant who lives but a few days,&lt;br/&gt; or an old man who does not live out his years;&lt;br/&gt;the one who dies at a hundred&lt;br/&gt; will be thought a mere child” (Isaiah 65:20, NIV)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Isaiah 65, the great prophet of the Jewish scriptures looks forward longingly to a day when no one would die in infancy, and 100-year-old grandparents would be considered youngsters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In saying this, he connects two things which have sometimes become separated: our physicality and our spirituality—our religious aspirations, and our desire to improve earthly life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We sometimes think that these are two separate, even competing, ideas. We sometimes think that being a spiritual person means not caring about the physical world. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This would have shocked the first Christians. For them, the resurrection of Jesus wasn’t simply a body coming back from the dead — it was the sign and declaration of God’s commitment to the world. In the resurrection, God was declaring that death’s days were numbered, and that he would be pushing back death from the universe, as he restored and redeemed creation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;St. Paul describes this in &lt;a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+15%3A22-26&amp;version=NIV"&gt;1 Corinthians 15&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+8%3A19-21&amp;version=NIV"&gt;Romans 8&lt;/a&gt; as a process that begins with Jesus and spreads outward until death is eradicated, and the entire cosmos is filled with freedom and life. For the first Christians, this was the mission of God. And they would participate in that process. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is why Jesus sends them out to heal the sick, feed the hungry, and bring life to the dead. He's asking them to &lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/2015/02/27/what-transhumanism-and-why-should-christians-care"&gt;participate&lt;/a&gt; in the fight against death in all its forms. No wonder, then, that even today so many hospitals have names like &lt;em&gt;Saint Thomas&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Saint Mary’s&lt;/em&gt; — healing has always been a significant part of the Christian mission. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, we have new options for extending that work. A new class of life extension technologies are being pursued by researchers from Google's &lt;a href="http://www.calicolabs.com/"&gt;Calico Labs&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="http://www.sens.org/"&gt;SENS foundation&lt;/a&gt;, and many others. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ultimate aim of many of these researchers is “indefinite life extension”, and an end to the aging process as we know it. But what does that mean?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Long History of Life Extension&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For all of human history prior to 1900, the primary way people died was infectious disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the last century, that’s changed dramatically. Our life expectancy has more than doubled, and the primary way humans die is now heart disease or cancer. We’ve changed how we die, and as a result, we’ve changed when we die.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Curing any major disease will change that again, extending life even farther. But we may be past the point of diminishing returns for fighting individual diseases. Now, we might need to do something more preventative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, when people die in their senior years, we chalk this up to “natural causes”. In reality, “natural causes” are just disease, and the diseases we associate with the aging process—like cancer, heart disease, dementia—are caused by the gradual accumulation of cellular damage. People don’t just grow old; rather, their bodies are subjected to relentless attack, day after day, until eventually, they aren’t able to repair the damage anymore. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Life extension technologies aim to repair this cellular damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When someone experiences a heart attack, we rush to restart their heart. When someone gets cancer, we work to remove the disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are now looking at the possibility of being able to address things before they get that far. We could heal the damage of heart disease before it becomes a heart attack, we could eliminate cancer before it grows into massive tumors, we could reverse accumulated brain damage, before it becomes full-blown dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s what it would mean to be able to heal cellular damage. But if we did that, the aging process as we know it would be over. Instead of facing a slow decline into inevitable terminal illness, our parents and grandparents would experience a long and healthy life, able to see their grandchildren and their grandchildren’s grandchildren.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This wouldn’t be the end of death—but death would no longer involve a painful, extended process of ever-worsening degeneration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much of the pain and suffering of the senior years would be removed. The struggle of watching loved ones lose a debilitating battle with illness would be relieved. Aging would stop being seen as a loss, and begin to be seen as the unmitigated opportunity to gain wisdom and experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Naturally, many people have significant concerns. Would this technology be only for the rich? What about over-population?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are good questions. Curing disease and extending lifespan has always created new challenges, and this will be no different. But that’s not a reason to avoid doing good—rather, it’s a reason to be proactive and visionary, and to aggressively tackle these challenges as they arise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Life Extension and The Biblical Vision&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;So is this scenario of increased lifespans consistent with the Biblical vision?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, it is. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, it’s consistent with the Biblical commission to heal the sick, and the Christian tradition of establishing hospitals and caring for the ill. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, these technologies would be repairing physical damage — which is continuous with current medical treatment and practice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Third, it would relieve vast amounts of human suffering — the currently unavoidable disease and degeneracy of late middle age. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fourth, it would improve the depth and wisdom and resilience of our culture. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And finally, it is exactly what the prophet Isaiah hoped and longed for — a day when everyone would get to see their grandchildren and their grandchildren’s grandchildren — a day when your hundredth birthday meant you were just a child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/micah-redding/why-christians-should-sup_1_b_9190470.html"&gt;Published at Huffington Post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2015/08/07/infinite-morality-jesus/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2015/08/07/infinite-morality-jesus/</link><pubDate>Fri Aug 07 21:43:59 CDT 2015</pubDate><title>The Infinite Morality of Jesus</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>In his book, [The Beginning of Infinity](http://amzn.to/1W6ETZN), David Deutsch argues that there are moments when something switches from being of only limited and local use, to having infinite reach...</description><content:encoded>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;In his book, &lt;a href="http://amzn.to/1W6ETZN"&gt;The Beginning of Infinity&lt;/a&gt;, David Deutsch argues that there are moments when something switches from being of only limited and local use, to having infinite reach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’ve ever played around with Roman Numerals, you’ve experienced a bit of this. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a kid, I loved Roman Numerals. They were sort of a secret code, and at the same time, they made a kind of sense that regular numbers just don’t make. Roman Numerals were perfect for carving into stone or a piece of wood, and because they were just based on adding together larger and smaller values, they were highly intuitive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea is simple: you start with a symbol for “one”. For two, you write two symbols. For three, you write three symbols. When you start getting to the point where the symbols are getting a bit unwieldy, you invent a new symbol. So now you write “V” instead of five ones, and you continue as before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://res.cloudinary.com/micahredding/image/upload/v1453076317/roman_numerals.jpg" alt="" title="" class="image-full" style="max-width: 100%; height:auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One? I&lt;br/&gt;Two? II&lt;br/&gt;Five? V&lt;br/&gt;Six? VI&lt;br/&gt;Ten? X&lt;br/&gt;Twenty? XX&lt;br/&gt;One thousand? M&lt;br/&gt;Two thousand? MM &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if you try to deal with large numbers, you run into problems. How do you represent one million? Would you line up a thousand M’s? Would you just keep inventing new symbols? What happens when you run out of symbols that are easy to write, or easy to tell apart?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It quickly becomes apparent that Roman Numerals, as nifty as they are, don’t scale. They aren’t appropriate for dealing with the number of people in a city, much less the numbers needed for economics or physics. The core limitation is that Roman Numerals need a totally new symbol for every order of magnitude (ones, fives, tens, fifties, hundreds, thousands). And so, no matter how many symbols you create, it will never be enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arabic numerals, on the other hand, don’t suffer from this problem. They use something called &lt;em&gt;place notation&lt;/em&gt;. This means that we don’t need a new symbol for every order of magnitude, we just need to shift one step to the left.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1&lt;br/&gt;10&lt;br/&gt;100&lt;br/&gt;1000&lt;br/&gt;10000&lt;br/&gt;100000&lt;br/&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You get the point. Where Roman Numerals were limited by the number of symbols that someone could etch into a rock, Arabic numerals have unlimited reach. They can represent literally any number imaginable, and never require any new symbols to be invented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I see it, the Law of Moses is like Roman Numerals, and Jesus is like place notation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://res.cloudinary.com/micahredding/image/upload/v1453076319/ten_commandments.jpg" alt="" title="" class="image-full" style="max-width: 100%; height:auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Law of Moses, in so many ways, was great. It addressed every aspect of human life. It gave straight-forward answers to difficult questions. It created unity and cohesiveness and social strength, perhaps at a level that has never been matched.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if you read it, you can see its limits. It contains instructions on roof building, clothing, and food that only make sense in the ancient desert. It doesn’t address electricity, bioethics, democracy, or any number of other issues that have come up in the last 3000 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people have tried to rectify this situation. Some rejected modern society, and took up an ancient way of life, hoping it would fit with the Mosaic Law. Others tried to slice up the Law in some way, applying pieces of it strictly, and other pieces not at all. Still others focused on the big ten (the 10 commandments) and asserted that they were the really important part.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;None of these approaches can escape the fact that the Law of Moses was created for an ancient tribal society. Even those who try to recreate the lifestyle of 2000BC can’t recreate an entire nomadic tribe — and consequently, they can’t actually practice the core of the Mosaic Law: the tabernacle and its religious sacrifices and rituals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jesus, however, established a different sort of system. He redefined almost every concept in the Law to be related to intrinsic motivation and aim. He boiled down ethics to “Love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength…and love your neighbor as yourself”. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In doing so, he created a system with infinite reach. While the Mosaic Law wouldn’t work outside of the ancient desert, Jesus’ morality would work just as well in the Andromeda galaxy. While the Mosaic Law couldn’t address new situations, Jesus’ morality could address any situation imaginable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, when asked about matters of ritual cleanliness (a big deal in the Law), he said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Listen to me, everyone, and understand this. Nothing outside a person can defile them by going into them. Rather, it is what comes out of a person that defiles them…(In saying this, Jesus declared all foods clean.)…For it is from within, out of a person’s heart, that evil thoughts come—sexual immorality, theft, murder, adultery, greed, malice, deceit, lewdness, envy, slander, arrogance and folly. All these evils come from inside and defile a person. (Mark 7:14-23)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is one thing to tell people that (say) bacon is no longer unclean. It is another thing to say that there will no longer be &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; foods which are unclean. And it is still another thing to challenge the basis of the entire rule itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is what Jesus does, not only moving away from clean and unclean foods, but moving away from regulations based on exterior actions. In Jesus’ framework, the things which have moral significance are things which arise in the core of a person and spread outwards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means that morality is no longer based on your environment, but on &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;. And so, suddenly, “clean and unclean” stop being categories which refer to a finite list of things and activities, and become categories which can operate across the universe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jesus doesn’t stop there. He does the same thing with questions of adultery, lying, covetousness, and even murder. And when asked for the greatest commandment in the Law, Jesus replies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.’ This is the first and greatest commandment. And the second is like it: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’ All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments. (Matthew 22:37)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last line is crucial. Jesus is stating that &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; is the core of the Law, and everything else is implementation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paul, the main expositor of Jesus’ message, picks up on this theme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let no debt remain outstanding, except the continuing debt to love one another, for whoever loves others has fulfilled the law. The commandments, “You shall not commit adultery,” “You shall not murder,” “You shall not steal,” “You shall not covet,” and whatever other command there may be, are summed up in this one command: “Love your neighbor as yourself.” Love does no harm to a neighbor. Therefore love is the fulfillment of the law. (Romans 13:8-10) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the entire law is fulfilled in keeping this one command: “Love your neighbor as yourself.” (Galatians 5:14) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my experience, Christians often pass over passages like this as if they were insignificant. But they weren’t insignificant to the early Christians: they were the core of a revolutionary new understanding of faith that promised — for the first time in history — a morality that could work across the entire world, and then keep going, on to infinity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away.” (Matthew 24:35)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;If all that Jesus and his followers had done was to update the rules to apply to a new situation — if all that had changed was that one set of commands was replaced with another set of commands — then Jesus’ morality would not be unique or special. It would be just another moral code amongst the moral codes of other great teachers and leaders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Jesus does more than this. At a fundamental level, he does away with finite rules and laws altogether. And he replaces them with an infinite motivation, one that makes every other ethical and moral system redundant — one that calls to bigger and better things than had ever been conceived before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From this point on, there is a new fundamental. Human nature may change, the earth may change, the sun may burn out and the galaxy dissolve. But whatever kinds of life there may be in our future, they will be defined by their reaction to a core motivation — a motivation that, recognized or not, is the infinite morality of Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://res.cloudinary.com/micahredding/image/upload/v1453076320/cosmos1.jpg" alt="" title="" class="image-full" style="max-width: 100%; height:auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/09/13/1347577352/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/09/13/1347577352/</link><pubDate>Thu Sep 13 18:02:32 CDT 2012</pubDate><title>1347577352</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>James L.

Carroll - if I understand what you are saying, you are suggesting that since information is lost in the process of nesting worlds, the exterior worlds contain more information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Agreed.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further, you are saying that an observer in the simulated world takes up information-space in the exterior world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Agreed.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further, you are saying that since simulated observers take up information-space in the exterior world, there are more observers "occupying the exterior world" than observers occupying the simulated ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is true if by "occupying the exterior world", you mean "taking up resources in the exterior world". But that seems to miss the point of the simulation argument. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The simulation argument can be re-stated as the assertion that observers occupying multiple levels of simulation outnumber those occupying only one level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We could make a similar argument with respect to the way our computer systems are built. Technologies are far more likely to employ several levels of processing than they are to employ only one level of processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Websites, for example, often use code written in Javascript, which is run on a Javascript interpreter in a browser kit, which runs on an Operating System on top of some levels of system technology, which runs on a machine which may employ some forms of emulation before hitting the "metal".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When taking a survey of all the code in existence, I'm betting that most of it uses some form of layering, and very little exists only at the "metal".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly with observers. It seems very unlikely that most of us exist only at the metal. If we have simulation technology available, most observers will end up occupying multiple levels of simulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original: &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/transfigurism/permalink/10152096982820436/?comment_id=10152100789385436&amp;offset=0&amp;total_comments=21"&gt;https://www.facebook.com/groups/transfigurism/permalink/10152096982820436/?comment_id=10152100789385436&amp;offset=0&amp;total_comments=21&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/moana-and-reading-scripture/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/moana-and-reading-scripture/</link><pubDate>Wed Jun 21 19:24:17 CDT 2017</pubDate><title>Moana and Reading Scripture</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>I love the movie Moana.

And, particularly, I love &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVzDrqOmYiY"&gt;this song&lt;/a&gt;—both because it’s a great song, and because it perfectly encapsulates a deep truth about reading scripture, or any kind of story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Listen to it!)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NVzDrqOmYiY?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the surface, the meaning of the song is clear: “Happiness is where you are”—and as a result, you must be sure that “no one leaves”, because the small village you were born in is all anyone could ever need or want.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if you’ve seen Moana, you know that this is exactly the opposite of the moral of the story. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So why is this song here?! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The song is here because the point of the story is that Moana needs to make her own choices, and in order to do so, she needs to hear all sides, as fully and completely as possible. So right in the middle of this movie about voyaging and discovery is a song where the other side gets to make its case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be sure, there is truth here as well. There &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; something true about finding happiness right where you are. And ultimately, Moana will be able to take that truth, and integrate it into the larger truth that she was destined to be a voyager.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So the stay-at-home point of view makes its case—boldly and loudly and boisterously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then, right in the middle of it, there’s a still, small voice:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;You are your father's daughter&lt;br/&gt;Stubbornness and pride&lt;br/&gt;Mind what he says but remember&lt;br/&gt;You may hear a voice inside&lt;br/&gt;And if the voice starts to whisper&lt;br/&gt;To follow the farthest star&lt;br/&gt;Moana, that voice inside is&lt;br/&gt;Who you are&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moana’s grandmother represents the still deeper truths that gave rise to her community, but are no longer remembered or openly practiced there. In her playfulness and prophetic “craziness”, she is free to honor her people’s tradition, while reminding them of where that tradition came from, and what it is really about. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her message to Moana is to look below the surface of the story, the surface of the community, the surface of the song, and listen for the spirit of truth itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That spirit, that truth, is the source of the island that everyone else is so concerned about sticking with. Below the surface meaning, the song itself testifies to the profound nature of the island community. And ultimately, Moana will realize that to be true to the island, she will have to seem to leave it—reconnecting with her voyaging roots in order to reawaken its spirit and life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So Moana’s grandmother makes her point, and then steps aside while the alternative case continues. Like &lt;a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Joshua+5%3A13-15&amp;version=NIV"&gt;Joshua’s encounter with a stranger&lt;/a&gt; or the interlude with Melchizedek, she plants a seed that will later grow into a full-blown realization, and provoke a dramatic and courageous transformation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is how scripture works, because it’s how stories work. And it’s how stories work, because it’s how human life works.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2011/11/21/christianity-reborn/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2011/11/21/christianity-reborn/</link><pubDate>Mon Nov 21 10:18:32 CST 2011</pubDate><title>Christianity reborn</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>Today, I'm starting a new email list about [Christianity as the anti-religion](http://micahredding.com/xn).

And the thing that concerns me the most is that, as the major institutions of Christianity begin to fall apart, and new forms of spirituality begin to rise, that the peculiar genius of the Christian idea is being missed and obscured. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm not interested in a kind of emaciated, "it's not great, but it's mine", form of Christianity. I want a positive, aggressively forward-looking, humble but magnificent vision. And I think that the vision of Jesus and the early Christians is just that, an untapped well of insight and imagination that has barely begun to be felt. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I intend to explore what Christianity has to offer the world now, and what that looks like in a post-religious spirituality. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not that I have all this figured out. There are many big questions to be asked and answered. But we are heading into a time that is going to be drastically different than what has been, and I think we have the tools and framework to see that this will be the most &lt;em&gt;christian&lt;/em&gt; era yet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Christianity that has come before us is just a sort of stumble at the front steps. The Christianity that will come next is about to open the door to the rest of the mansion. &lt;/p&gt;

It was 11:00 p.m. on Friday, September 15th, and we had been focused and working hard for the past 7 hours on some of our newest tracks for the upcoming album release in&lt;br /&gt;Spring 2007. Gabe was already exhibiting the beginning signs of silliness-due-to-sleep-deprivation, and Micah was becoming increasingly more unreasonable. Luckily I was around to bring some sanity to the discussion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“The tempo is already at 160, and I think if we increase it any more, we risk making the vocals muddy and the lyrics slurred,” Stephen, our engineer stated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gabe disagreed. “I think it sounds good now, but we would definitely play it faster that that live, and I think it might sound a little better that way.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Micah, reclining in his armchair with an obvious “smarter-than-thou” smirk smeared across his face, responded, “Well, why don’t we do this: let’s skip recording for one take, and just go plug in and play a couple bars of the song at the tempo we would naturally perform it at, and you and John can decide what you think&lt;br /&gt;then.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;John Sherrod, our Producer for the evening, agreed, “I think it sounds great how it is, and it’s hard for me to believe there would be a better sound by speeding it up, but we can definitely try it.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The three of us headed back into the isolation rooms to strap back in and do the take. A few minutes later we re-emerged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“It was almost immediate when we heard that take that we knew we liked the first one better,” said John. “It was just too hard to distinguish the lyrics, and it didn’t flow quite as well either, I don’t think.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I’m always after you guys to play slower on-stage anyway,” I chimed in with a laugh. “But I would never say ‘I told you so’.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Micah decided he was good with it. Tonight’s projects were “Folsom Prison Blues” (not appearing on the album, but being recorded for fun) and our own song “Fine”, planned for release early next year. We had laid down the acoustic guitar, bass, drum, and lead vocal tracks, mainly aiming to get the rhythm parts on record. The acoustic guitar and vocal parts were recorded by Micah at the same time, just to&lt;br /&gt;keep us all in sync, but we knew we would have to record those over individually at separate times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gabe and I each had our own isolation room for the takes, and Micah played and sung in the main room between ours. John, Stephen, and the rest of the studio staff stayed behind the glass in the production room monitoring us and catching it all on the ProTools HD recording system (which, by the way, was pretty sweet.) After each take, we headed back to the production room and listen to what we had just recorded to decide if we wanted to keep it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We started out with an 8-hour time block, and considering that it took us 2 and a half hours to set up (thanks in part to a lot of technical difficulties), by the end of the night, we had a very good product for the amount of time we actually put into it. Both Stephen and John said they were impressed with how good it sounded “raw”&lt;br /&gt;without any mixing or effects, and that kind of made us feel good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the next few months we’ll be spending a lot of time in the studio working on the forthcoming album. We’ll be heading back into the studio this next weekend to record vocals and harmony for “Fine” and “Folsom”, and to begin work on two more tracks for the album. We’ll let you know how the next session goes in Part Two.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/05/07/something-wrong-world/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/05/07/something-wrong-world/</link><pubDate>Mon May 07 09:34:38 CDT 2012</pubDate><title>Something wrong with the world</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>In the movie The Matrix, Morpheus prods Neo to think about his emotions over the course of his lifetime.

...</description><content:encoded>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;In the movie The Matrix, Morpheus prods Neo to think about his emotions over the course of his lifetime. Hadn't he always felt out-of-place? Hadn't he always felt that something was not quite right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, the answer was yes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think this is a common feeling among thoughtful people. But I'm not sure Morpheus had the right answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Isaac Newton looked up at the night sky, he must have been confounded by what he saw. How did it move? Why did it move? What complexity governed the placement of objects in the heavens?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then he crafted his theory of gravitation. And suddenly, it all made sense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a while. After all, by the time Einstein started working on his papers, much more had been discovered. Why did the measurements of the locations of planets not coincide exactly with the theories? Why couldn't they get the measurements of light's speed to come out correctly?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then Einstein proposed his solution, and the world made sense again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we don't understand the way the world works, things will seem off. Maybe our lives will feel just a little weird. Maybe the edges of our experience will seem frayed a little, as if there's something going on that we just can't see.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And maybe one day, we'll suddenly see something, and the world will snap into focus, and everything will make sense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So if you feel a little &lt;em&gt;off&lt;/em&gt;, it's probably not your imagination. But you also probably don't need to escape into a dystopian future where man and machine are eternally at war. You might just need to discover something new about the way your world works.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2006/12/27/satan-a-snake-angels-are-dragons-old-testament-word-and-the-secrets-of-the-bible/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2006/12/27/satan-a-snake-angels-are-dragons-old-testament-word-and-the-secrets-of-the-bible/</link><pubDate>Wed Dec 27 01:13:00 CST 2006</pubDate><title>Satan a Snake?

In Genesis 6, these are the offspring of the "sons of God" and the "daughters of men". This word is usually translated "giants", as it is in Numbers 13:33. But the word actually just derives from "nephal", meaning "fallen". The Nephilim were simply "the fallen ones".&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) The Serpent. The serpent was more cunning than the beasts of the field, and tempted Eve to eat of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil. When she did so, her eyes were opened, and she could discern good and evil. Interesting thing is, the word "serpent" here is the EXACT same word for "foretelling the future, divination, prophesying" or "discerning". So, the DISCERNER (serpent) was more DISCERNING (cunning) than the beasts, and tempted Eve to eat of the Tree of DISCERNING (knowledge of) Good and Evil. See a pattern?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) The Seraphim. The Seraphim are described in Isaiah 6:1-6 as beings immensely close to the glory of God, whose sole purpose is to display that glory. They have six wings, two to cover their eyes, two to cover their feet, two to fly with. I always imagined them as humans, and they were always described as being at the very top of the different orders of angels (seraphim, cherubim, archangels, angels, etc).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Interesting thing is, the word "seraphim" means literally "fiery serpent", and is translated that way in most locations, including Numbers 21:6-8 and Deuteronomy 8:15. So, we have "fiery serpents" with wings...hmmm. Sounds to me like dragons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the seraphim are not some "angelic" human beings with wings. Instead, they are huge, fiery, six-winged dragons. Wow...weird.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that may be connected back to the serpent in the garden of Eden. The serpent (assuming it was something like a seraphim), would have been a glorious dragon accustomed to flying. And as his punishment, he had to crawl on the ground, no longer flying or walking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Weird.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2007/06/03/the-problem-of-evil-part-2-the-multiverse-vs-gnosticism/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2007/06/03/the-problem-of-evil-part-2-the-multiverse-vs-gnosticism/</link><pubDate>Sun Jun 03 22:56:00 CDT 2007</pubDate><title>The Problem of Evil, part 2 - The Multiverse vs Gnosticism</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>In the previous post, I've tried to establish that the given answers to the Problem of Evil are not only incorrect, but they almost always lead us towards dangerous philosophies that directly oppose t...</description><content:encoded>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;&lt;div&gt;In the &lt;a href="/blog/2007/05/27/the-problem-of-evil-part-1-the-unanswered-question"&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt;, I've tried to establish that the given answers to the Problem of Evil are not only incorrect, but they almost always lead us towards dangerous philosophies that directly oppose the bible and Christianity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To complete the picture, I want to address two more things - one is another proposed answer, the other is another brick to pile on our list of "problems" with God.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One last tactic taken in attempting to answer the Problem of Evil is to downplay evil itself. If we say that physical suffering is not really that bad, then we can absolve God of guilt. We can say that suffering produces character (and this is true), therefore it is good to have suffering. But this flies in the face of a biblical value system. Can we really say that rape leaves the victims better off? Can we really say that all the people who died from the tsunami are building character? Can we really claim that the Jews are better off for the holocaust?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are the mind-numbing things we end up implying if we try to downplay the significance of evil. They devalue the physical existence, in order to claim that only the spiritual matters (more traces of gnosticism). And they end up robbing us of a humane value system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, the bible seems to have no qualms about placing the blame for all events squarely on God's shoulders (thanks to &lt;a href="http://transmillennial.blogspot.com/"&gt;Kevin&lt;/a&gt; for pointing this out):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;span style=";font-family:Verdana;font-size:85%;"  &gt;&lt;i&gt;"I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and create evil: I the LORD do all these things." &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=";font-family:Verdana;font-size:85%;"  &gt;Isaiah 45:7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;It's as if God was saying, "don't even think of blaming someone else!" God wants us to know that no other force is interfering with his plans. If a disaster happens, we can look to no one other than God. So much for our "Satan-is-to-blame" theory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If Christianity is going to continue to exist, it needs a coherent argument against both atheism, and gnosticism. The indications are good that in the absence of such an argument, the world will head towards one of these options or the other. This argument needs to deal with the Problem of Evil head-on: without degrading our own moral responsibility and sensitivity, and without diminishing God in any way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Historical Christianity has always struggled with its inherent tendency to devolve towards gnosticism, and as the Problem of Evil becomes more acute in people's minds, this tendency will continue. Without an answer, gnosticism or atheism will win out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I believe there IS an answer to be found, and that this answer is unique. I believe that there never will be another answer that will ever work. Further, I believe that this answer solves almost all of the ancillary questions to the Problem of Evil: Why does God hide? Does God answer prayers? Why does God sometimes do miracles, and sometimes does not? How do we reconcile God's omniscience with Free Will?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But to discover this answer, we need to understand a theory in modern physics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suspect that many people will not like this. After all, should we really come to a better understanding of God through something as crass as science? I think this attitude is an example of our tendency towards gnostic thought. God has told us that creation is "very good", but we sometimes want to believe that God is so separate and apart from a "dirty" creation, that nothing we humans can discover would be of any use in understanding God.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the bible has always told us otherwise. Not only is God present everywhere, but the ways of understanding him are present everywhere as well. And when asking questions about the nature of our existence and this creation, it only makes sense to take into account the insights of science. Especially when those insights FINALLY give us an answer to the most difficult theological problem of all time.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;All attempts to answer the Problem of Evil postulate a theory about the universe. The Gnostic answer is that the universe is composed of two co-equal forces fighting it out, one ruling the spirit world and one ruling the physical world. Other answers give us other theories of reality.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;But physics has revealed what I believe to be the truth about the nature of reality. Let me explain this truth, then discuss WHY it solves our questions.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;The truth is that our universe is really a multiverse, a collection of an infinite number of different histories. In the multiverse, all possibilities have and DO happen.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every time a decision is made, every time there are different alternatives that could happen, all of them actually DO happen. We only see one of these history-paths because of the way in which our perceptions are limited. But God sees all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;This fact has been very well-established by quantum physics, and despite the philosophical hesitations many have in accepting it, it is nevertheless true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Schrodinger famously proposed an experiment called "Schrodinger's Cat" to demonstrate how ludicrous quantum phyics was. In this experiment, scientists place a cat in a box, then place a small bit of cyanide poison in the box with the cat. The cyanide will only be released if a radiation detector goes off. This radiation detector is set to trigger if a particle emits a certain amount of radiation. The scientists then shoot a particle into the radiation detector which has a 50/50 chance of emitting radiation. A couple of minutes later, the scientists open the box to discover if the particle emitted the radiation, triggered the detector, released the cyanide and killed the cat. According to our suppositions, the cat should have a 50/50 chance of being alive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But according to quantum physics, the cat is both alive AND dead! This result led many people to be uncomfortable with quantum physics, to try to disprove it, or to try to interpret it away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may have heard of the "Copenhagen Interpretation" of quantum physics, which suggests that when the scientists open the box, they get to decide whether the cat is alive or dead. They don't realize it, but by looking at the cat, they are deciding. The Copenhagen Interpretation attempts to explain away what quantum physics actually says by attaching some magical power to humans, which allows them to control the universe with their minds. This is the reason you'll see so many new age mystics talking about quantum physics. They're actually talking about the Copenhagen Interpretation, which allows them to teach a lot of crazy things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if we take quantum physics for what it says (and it is the most well-tested theory in all of science), then we live amongst a multitude of histories. Every decision we make, every time we flip a coin, every time there are options in our world, every time the universe could take one path or the other...it actually takes both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that is a good thing, because it means we really DO have Free Will (but we'll save that for another time), that God really does know all of history, and that we can finally understand why evil exists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...to be continued...&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;Part &lt;a href="/blog/2007/05/27/the-problem-of-evil-part-1-the-unanswered-question"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="/blog/2007/06/03/the-problem-of-evil-part-2-the-multiverse-vs-gnosticism"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="/blog/2007/06/03/the-problem-of-evil-part-3-and-god-saw-the-multiverse-and-it-was-good"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2010/04/18/the-structure-of-human-hope-speculations-on-immortality/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2010/04/18/the-structure-of-human-hope-speculations-on-immortality/</link><pubDate>Sun Apr 18 12:59:46 CDT 2010</pubDate><title>The Structure of Human Hope: speculations on immortality</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>In my previous posts (1, 2, 3), I've tried to be careful not to offer any speculation on the actual nature of resurrection or immortality.

Instead, I've tried to follow the scriptures, and simply hold out trust and confidence in a God who is continually leading humanity to higher and higher levels of growth and progress, who cares for each one of us individually, and who never lets any of us go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think that is a secure and sound foundation for our hope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But here, I want to offer a little in the way of speculation. Most people are unaware that science actually suggests a concrete and physically-real immortality. They are unaware because scientists are largely unsure what to do with it philosophically, and so simply choose to ignore it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They are unsure how to handle it philosophically because philosophy is built on human intuition, and the areas of science that deal in issues of immortality are quite counter-intuitive. I'm talking, of course, about Quantum Mechanics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let me be clear here. Nothing in the scriptures suggest what I'm about to describe. I believe the scriptures are &lt;em&gt;consistent&lt;/em&gt; with what I'm saying, but they do not tell us this information. We should not expect them to. The scriptures encourage a deep confidence in God's care and protection of us, and leave discussion of the afterlife to exactly that. We must leave the rest of the details up to science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So here is what science tells us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the mathematics of Quantum Mechanics, the results of any event are probabilistic. Flip a coin, and there's a 50% chance it will come up heads, and a 50% chance it will come up tails. Shoot a gun into the air, and there's a large chance the bullet will fall harmlessly to the ground. But there is a small chance it will fall in precisely the right manner to kill someone else. This much seems straight-forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Quantum Mechanics doesn't actually say sometimes one thing happens, and sometimes another thing happens. It actually says that in all cases, &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; things happen. When you flip a coin, the math doesn't specify that it might come down heads or tails, it specifies that the coin came down 50% heads and 50% tails. When you shoot a bullet into the air, it specifies that the bullet came down 99% harmless, and 1% fatal. Further, it specifies that your bullet-victim is not actually alive or dead, but 99% alive, and 1% dead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are two ways you can interpret this bizarre science. One - it doesn't really have anything to do with reality. Two - it has everything to do with reality. In Quantum Mechanics, they call interpretation one the "Copenhagen Interpretation". Interpretation two is called the "Many Worlds Interpretation".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Copenhagen Interpretation was the prevailing interpretation for many years, simply because the alternatives were unthinkable. But the Copenhagen Interpretation doesn't come without costs. In order to deal with the discrepancy between the math and the observed reality, they had to invent a new effect - an effect in which the person who observes the flipping coin mysteriously "decides" which result actually happens. This is as bothersome as the alternatives they were trying to avoid, and has resulted in a slew of pseudo-scientific quantum mysticism. More importantly, it doesn't actually explain anything. It doesn't suggest a way in which this phenomenon works, and it simply assumes this phenomenon into existence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the Many Worlds Interpretation doesn't assume anything other than what the mathematics already tell us. It simply takes the mathematics at their word, and accepts the troublesome fact: our universe consists of an infinity of different histories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the coin is flipped, the mathematics tell us the truth: history splits into two streams, one in which the coin lands heads-up, and the other in which it lands tails-up. When the bullet is shot, history splits into a stream in which it comes down harmlessly, signaling the start of a race, and a stream in which it comes down fatally, killing an innocent bystander, causing scandal, grief, and possibly revenge. Every decision we make, every event that happens, results in a splitting of history into two or more streams of results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people find this picture appalling. But to me, it makes a deep sense. It gives a deep meaning to the concept of free will - rather than constrain us to a single history in which every move is predetermined, it gives us the vast expanse of possibility in which to truly and actually flex our decision-making capability. Only in this picture are the various alternatives presented to us actually &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I mentioned that the Copenhagen Interpretation has been the prevailing interpretation for many years. For many people, this is still true. But among the physicists most involved with the relevant areas of science (Stephen Hawking, etc), the Many Worlds Interpretation now (rightly) prevails. The math is simply too convincing, and the alternative is not just another interpretation, but actually requires inventing a new effect to make it fit our preferred view of the world. That's not how science is supposed to work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So the Many Worlds Interpretation appears to be correct, and the consequence is that we now have to adjust our view of reality to deal with living in a multiverse instead of a universe. As with all scientific discoveries, this will require a lot of rethinking. But that is exactly why we value science - it shows us the world as it really is, not as we expect it to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of significant consequences to this understanding, but I only want to deal with one at the moment. That is, of course, immortality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A moment's thought will show why the Many Worlds Interpretation is relevant to mortality. Most people's deaths are highly dependent on random probability - whether one leaves their house a minute earlier or later, which cells get exposed to the sun, how the blood clots flow through the bloodstream. Without too much effort, we can probably all think of times when, if something went a little differently, we would be dead now. According to the Many Worlds Interpretation, those situations actually went both ways, and in one history, you died, and in this history, you lived.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you can contemplate that for a minute, you may begin to ask yourself why &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; are the one alive right now. And science's answer is that &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; are actually a stream of branching histories, spreading out through the multiverse, trying out every experience in the realm of possibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the moment of potential death, there are always at least two paths forward - one in which you die, another in which by the slightest chance, you survive. But it should be obvious that you will never experience the path in which you are dead. Instead, as you come to the moment of death, you will see only the path forward in which you survive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And naturally, there are histories in which you die. But on the scale of the multiverse, these histories are not dead ends, they are rocks in the stream, diverting the flow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your death is then never the end. It is, instead, the diversion of your life into other paths through the multiverse. You will never notice this diversion - instead, your life will continue on in more and more interesting histories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those of us who experience your death, this will naturally and rightly be a sad thing. We will miss your presence with us in our history. But for you, history never ends. Without skipping a beat - you continue on, living your life on the same earth, with many of the same people - but in a different history than we are left to experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And so tonight, you can step out on your porch, look up at the stars, and know that you have billions and billions of years in which to explore and experience this magnificent, unfathomable universe.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2007/04/13/the-second-album-part-5-release/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2007/04/13/the-second-album-part-5-release/</link><pubDate>Fri Apr 13 23:46:00 CDT 2007</pubDate><title>The Second Album, Part 5: Release</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>The big day was finally here: the release party for our second full length album, and the most important concert we'd ever done.Waking up on a day like this is always kind of interesting.

I've had this same day several times in the past, though it's completely new each time. I've tried to put a finger on it — I think the feeling must be similar to what it's like waking up on the day when you know you're going to die. Fate and time run together and &lt;span style="font-style:italic;"&gt;you know it's your day&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doretta our manager had strictly warned us to go to sleep early the night before, but nevertheless, I had found myself staying up with family members until 1:00 - 2:00 a.m. And now, just 6 hours later, I was pulling into the private loading area of the Charleston Civic Center.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though I had a long 11 hours in front of me preparing for tonight's show, I knew those hours would go by all too quickly, and if the past were any indicator, those hours would also have their share of small crises. Even after spending only a short time on the road touring, you start to learn that things &lt;span style="font-style:italic;"&gt;always&lt;/span&gt; go wrong, no matter how prepared you are. Luckily, we have Gabe for resourcefulness, Micah for problem-solving, and me to keep everyone calm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We had 3 deliveries of various equipment passed through the loading bay doors at the back of the Theater, including one truck with a broken refrigerator and a junk desk someone had agreed to loan us at the last moment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This happened to be the first time the Redding Brothers have had official employees. Jim, our sound engineer, helped us setup and mesh our own sound system in with the theater's equipment. But as we plugged everything in to do sound checks, as fate would have it, there was just something wrong with the sound. After fooling around with the EQ and other settings, to no avail, Jim pulled us aside and said, "This isn't working."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crisis #1.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luckily a bad situation turned into a good one when we were able to locate a more powerful, clean-sounding speaker and sub system nearby, which we rented for a very reasonable price. Jim agreed to pick it up on his lunch break, and said we could probably have it setup just in time for the television news crew that was arriving after lunch to tape some pre-concert footage, so we agreed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But again fate stepped in and said, "no, it can't be that easy". Jim arrived back from lunch a little late, and it took a little bit longer than predicted to setup the new sound system. When the news crew arrived, we were still sifting through a mess of tangled speaker cable trying to setup one system at the same time we were tearing another down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crisis #2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The news people were understanding, however, and 15 minutes later we were powered up and running through acoustic sets in front of the camera. I heard we showed up on the news broadcast that evening, but I've still never seen the footage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our opening act, Bug Lilly, who is a local artist in the Charleston area, had initially been told sound check for them would be around 2:30. It was 2:30 already, and we were still working bugs out of our own stage show and sound system. Eventually they were pushed back to 5:00 p.m., but somehow were very understanding of the whole situation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We finally finished up sound checks and rehearsals, and turned the stage over the Bug and his crew for their sound check. We headed downstairs, below the stage and loading areas, to our dressing rooms to get ready for the big show.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the moment, everything we'd been doing for the last 3 and a half years of our lives had been leading to this night. Even I, who had been on stage performing in one way or another for most of my life, and who never really gets worked up about anything, found myself starting to get the butterflies as I walked down the concrete stairway in my socked feet. (I had removed my shoes earlier because my feet were starting to get sore from standing all day). Downstairs, Doretta had everything arranged for us, with snacks and water and even a special gift for each of us...awww :-).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though we were within 40 minutes of starting, it seemed that for the first time in three months we were finally able to just relax and breathe it all in. We were all goofing off, throwing random objects at each other, and laughing about nonsense. From time to time, random people would step in an take pictures, but it was kind of all a blur to me. We'd been working so hard promoting, traveling, setting up and tearing down, coordinating press and media promotions, talking to fans, and making appearances, and now it seemed like everything just abruptly stopped. That's when I realized there was something I'd forgotten: where were my clothes?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Uhhh...crisis #3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don't get me wrong, I wasn't standing around in the dressing room, talking to my brothers and having pictures taken of me in the nude, but the clothes I was supposed to wear for the show -- where had I put them?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had some of our helpers run and find a bag of things upstairs on the stage area behind the curtains. Luckily we found my shirt and shoes in that, but still no pants. You can't very well do a concert with no pants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suddenly everybody on our whole crew was involved in finding my pants. Checking this box, that bag, his car, our van, etc. Somewhere in all the frantic hilarity, somebody found a stray bag hidden in the back of somebody's trunk with my jeans in it, just in time for me to throw them on and get back stage as the emcee started his introduction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just another day in the life...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Josiah Redding is brother to Micah and Gabriel, who collectively make up the band we know as the Redding Brothers.

Feedback from a set of speakers and a mic is the usual example—the earsplitting phenomenon that whole industries are dedicated to avoiding. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These negative feedback loops don’t just happen in audio, however. They’re also a big deal in human behavior. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Addictions, obsessions, OCD, negative self-talk, and a whole lot more—are all manifestations of some kind of negative feedback loop. Some people would say that all mental illness is a manifestation of this one thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If so, then insanity is just the default state that people find themselves drifting towards, when certain protection mechanisms go away. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mic starts drifting toward the speakers…the person starts becoming more and more closed into their own mental world…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the danger of prosperity, of freedom, of time spent alone. “Your great learning has driven you mad!” was not an idle possibility—but a well-known danger posed by living in a world mostly defined by your own thoughts. Being a hermit was another way to expose yourself to this danger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That doesn’t mean that wealth, or freedom, or scholarship, or being alone are bad things. They’re all good in the right forms. They’re just occasions of significantly heightened danger, because they circumvent our natural built-in protection mechanisms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those mechanisms avoid feedback loops by forcing our choices to go through greater levels of engagement with the outside world. To eat, we have to work. To learn things, we have to engage with our teachers. To consume intoxicants, we have to go through a local distributor. To be safe, we have to be part of a community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we become rich enough to skip these constraints, or have enough free time to get around them, or are well-studied enough to leave our teachers behind—then we no longer have these natural constraints, and we are forced to either provide them for ourselves, or fly ever closer to the flames.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The obvious way to provide these constraints for ourselves is through self-discipline. And most truly successful people are incredibly disciplined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there’s something that is probably even more important than self-discipline: deep engagement with the outside world. This doesn’t just mean being around other people, or out in nature. It means letting the outside world &lt;em&gt;disrupt you&lt;/em&gt;, challenge you in significant ways. It means exposing your ideas to others, and allowing them to disagree and &lt;em&gt;prove you wrong&lt;/em&gt;. It means putting yourself in situations where people might disapprove of your behavior, or think you are kind of lame. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the beauty of travel—it can disrupt your view of the world and yourself in significant ways. This is the beauty of leaving your peer group behind for a while—it can disrupt your sense of what’s important, and who you really are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is precisely what people like Michael Jackson lost. Once he found himself surrounded by people who would say anything he wanted to hear, the only way that story could end was in tragedy. Conversely, what we admire in celebrities who seem “like normal people” is that they are still actively engaged in a world that can change them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Self-discipline can keep some of our destructive tendencies at bay, but ultimately self-discipline is only as good as the perspective we have—and the perspective we have is only as good as the size and depth and complexity of the world we engage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far, I’ve only been talking about negative feedback loops. But positive feedback loops also exist, and they’re not simply as powerful as the negative ones—they may be the most powerful thing in the universe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But positive feedback loops are harder to create. The conditions have to be just right, and they have to persist over a long period of time, and they have to be in the unique class of things that are simultaneously &lt;em&gt;playing with fire&lt;/em&gt;, and yet are incredibly positive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most significant positive feedback loop in history started with the Scientific Revolution—which unleashed a process of scientific exploration and study and critique that reworked the surface of this planet, lit up the dark side of the Earth, put footprints on the Moon, and shot human artifacts right out of the Solar System.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Music or artistic scenes are also feedback loops. When one takes off, as in the grunge scene of early 90s Seattle, people go from playing in basements to playing on world stages in months. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn’t just a matter of a surge in popularity. Often, it’s a surge in ability—a sudden burst of creative output that is rarely matched in quality or quantity ever again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly in sports. In “&lt;a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Rise-Superman-Decoding-Ultimate-Performance/dp/B00I9IGP68/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1518559699&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+rise+of+superman&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=micahredding-20&amp;linkId=6e6baa69a606e7c7224ad3485f89ed32"&gt;The Rise of Superman&lt;/a&gt;”, Stephen Kotler chronicles the exponential explosion of accomplishments achieved in extreme sports over just decades, or—in some cases—years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What conditions are necessary for launching positive feedback loops?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First and most essential, is engaging with a big, noisy, complex world.&lt;/strong&gt; This is the exact same thing that helps you break out of negative feedback loops. But where having something &lt;em&gt;outside yourself&lt;/em&gt; gets in the way of a negative, internally-focused feedback loop, having something outside yourself is precisely the fuel that a positive feedback loop needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Scientific Revolution, that outside world was literally the outside world. In an artistic or music scene, that outside world is the audience that keeps showing up to local shows, and the other artists or musicians providing each other with competition and inspiration. In the Beatles, that outside world was originally the music fans, but then increasingly became other bands such as the Rolling Stones and the Beach Boys, and eventually was just the ongoing creative rivalry between John Lennon and Paul McCartney.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second is the ability to produce something, and get detailed, nuanced feedback.&lt;/strong&gt; This is why the “world” you’re engaging with needs to be big and complex—without that, the feedback becomes a simple yes/no, or just a never-ending &lt;em&gt;meh&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Scientific Revolution had the biggest world possible, and all of its feedback was full of information that could be parsed in all kinds of ways. In fact, simplifying that feedback to something that could be acted on was one of the key breakthroughs that science achieved. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a music scene, feedback can be the reaction of the audience, the energy levels for the band members, how impressed or jealous other bands are, etc. This feedback is full of all kinds of information, with people responding in all kinds of different ways and to different degrees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a scene, an important aspect of the world you’re getting feedback from is that that world is itself changing in reaction to your actions. You play a new song that gets the crowd excited, and now the jealous other bands go back and write something to one-up you, and the process repeats. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Third, and finally, you need to be able to take that feedback and use it to create something new.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In science, you do experiments, and then create radical new theories to address all the weird data you’re getting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a music scene, you play a song, feel good about it, and then instantly write a song ten times more &lt;em&gt;like that&lt;/em&gt;. Or you play a song, feel bad about it, and write a song totally different than that. Or you play a song, feel good about parts of it, and write a new version that takes it in a totally different direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In extreme sports, you try a trick, like the way it works, and then try something 10x harder or 10x weirder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are the basic requirements, but in order to work, &lt;em&gt;it actually has to loop&lt;/em&gt;. The creation of something new has to result in producing it and getting feedback, almost immediately. When the time between creation and feedback gets too long, the feedback expires, or loses meaning and depth. It becomes too much like a simple yes/no, and all ability to get traction is lost. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Positive feedback loops are notoriously hard to maintain. As soon as the scene blows up, the production of new material slows down. As soon as the Beatles became famous, their ability to try out new material started to become impaired. So far, the Scientific Revolution has done pretty well, but it’s always an open question of whether it will continue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key to keeping these things going is that the process itself must evolve, must become part of a feedback loop. Science has succeeded largely by continuing to evolve and develop the scientific method—chucking the scientific method itself into a feedback loop of experiment and invention. The Beatles achieved as much as they did by shifting from receiving feedback primarily from their audience, to receiving feedback primarily from other bands, to receiving feedback primarily from each other. When they could no longer evolve their own process, the whole thing broke down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my life, stumbling into positive feedback loops has been responsible for the creation of almost everything I’m most proud of. They’ve pushed me into some of the most profound changes I have ever experienced. They’ve made me the person I am today. And they’ve given me my greatest moments of joy.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2007/12/20/proof-vs-the-bible/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2007/12/20/proof-vs-the-bible/</link><pubDate>Thu Dec 20 11:06:00 CST 2007</pubDate><title>Proof vs. The Bible</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>I like proofs.I find beauty in elegant mathematical facts, strung together to establish surprising truths with rock-hard precision.But as I've gotten older, I've reluctantly realized that bible study ...</description><content:encoded>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I like proofs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find beauty in elegant mathematical facts, strung together to establish surprising truths with rock-hard precision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as I've gotten older, I've reluctantly realized that bible study is not an area for "proofs".&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See, the bible is not a book of systematic theology, statements of cold fact, or logical deductions. It's a book of stories, poetry, proverbs, wit, allusions, and emotion. And it's hard to deduce cold logical statements from that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Church of Christ holds that instrumental music in a church service is &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;wrong&lt;/span&gt;. The argument is made based on a little-known principle called "The Law of Exclusion", which states that if something is not commanded, it is prohibited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, even the most staunch proponents of this view admit (when pressed) that this principle is largely dependent on human discretion. Concrete baptistries are not commanded either, nor are pulpits or church buildings. In fact, we have examples and commands to the contrary on all of those. But the argument goes that such things are "expedient".&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But one man's expediency is another man's heresy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bible is like history: it is messy. Like history, the bible is not the domain of cold, hard logic. We can no more prove that instrumental music is wrong than we can prove that Alexander The Great actually lived. We can no more prove that Alexander The Great lived than we can prove that Jesus really gave the sermon on the mountain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;History is the domain of &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;reasonable certainty&lt;/span&gt;. Not proof.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no way to prove anyone's existence in history. All we can do is piece together the evidence, use reason and sense, and make educated guesses. And we must always keep in mind the limits of our own knowledge, and the filters through which we view the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Logic doesn't have those limitations, but history does. And so does the bible. The best we can do is to use reason and sense to determine what the bible means with reasonable certainty, always keeping in mind our own limitations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don't read me wrong: I believe in cold, hard facts. I believe that questions about God and Jesus have true answers in cold, hard reality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the bible is not a collection of cold hard facts. It is story, and story through which we must filter our lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And when we venture outside the realm of proof to the realm of reasonable certainty, a wholly different degree of humility is required.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/rethinking-christianity/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/rethinking-christianity/</link><pubDate>Mon May 11 11:08:12 CDT 2015</pubDate><title>Rethinking Christianity</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>...</description><content:encoded>&lt;![CDATA[]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2008/09/15/there-no-hell-part-2-scriptures-waiting-around/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2008/09/15/there-no-hell-part-2-scriptures-waiting-around/</link><pubDate>Mon Sep 15 10:32:54 CDT 2008</pubDate><title>There Is No Hell (part 2) - The Scriptures, Waiting Around</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>The Scriptures

Since translations sometimes like to blur the distinctions between the words the original writers chose, we're going to highlight the original words in the text.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are three basic words translated "hell" in the New Testament: Gehenna, Hades, and Tartarus. There is one word sometimes translated "hell" in the Old Testament: Sheol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are also a couple of phrases (Lake of Fire, Eternal Punishment, Outer Darkness) that are important, and we'll look at those too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WAITING AROUND&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SHEOL&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Sheol is the word used in the Old Testament for the "home of the dead". Both the righteous and the wicked go there. Jacob talked again and again about going there. Job asked to go there to hide from God's anger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Psalms 16:10 talks about the Messiah going to Sheol. Acts 2:27 quotes that prophecy, but translates "Sheol", replacing it with "Hades".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So Hades and Sheol are synonymous, and simply refer to the place of the dead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HADES&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Hades is used in place of Sheol in the New Testament. As we've established, Hades refers to the "home of the dead", the place where righteous and wicked alike go after death. Jesus went there himself (Acts 2:31).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The great revelation in the New Testament is that Hades/Sheol is temporary. Hades can have nothing to do with eternal torment, because it is a temporary place that is emptied out before the judgment (Revelation 20:13-14).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ironically, the passage everyone brings up in discussing "hell" is about the Rich Man and Lazarus:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Luke 16:22-24&lt;br/&gt;22 "Now the poor man died and was carried away by the angels to Abraham's bosom; and the rich man also died and was buried. 23 "In Hades he lifted up his eyes, being in torment, and saw Abraham far away and Lazarus in his bosom. 24 "And he cried out and said, `Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus so that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool off my tongue, for I am in agony in this flame.'&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, I don't for a minute believe that this is a literal description of anything or anyplace. Jesus is telling a parable here about the Pharisees, and about how they won't even pay attention to a person resurrected from the dead. So they're going to find themselves cut off from Abraham, the very person they were putting all their trust in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BUT, it makes no difference whether this is literal or not. This passage is clearly talking about HADES. And as we've seen, Hades is a temporary location that lasts only until the judgment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite hundreds of sermons to the contrary, this parable has nothing to do with "hell".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TARTARUS&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;2 Peter 2:4&lt;br/&gt;"For if God did not spare angels when they sinned, but cast them into TARTARUS and committed them to pits of darkness, reserved for judgment"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the only place in the New Testament this word is used. All we're told here is that it is a place for angels (not humans), and that this is not a permanent location, but a place to wait for judgment. As such, it seems similar to HADES.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SUMMARY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the KJV translates Hades and Sheol as "hell". Almost all versions render "Tartarus" as hell. Yet it is plain that each of these refers to the idea of waiting for something to happen. None of them refer to an eternal state.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2007/01/15/who-is-god-the-secret-of-the-new-covenant/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2007/01/15/who-is-god-the-secret-of-the-new-covenant/</link><pubDate>Mon Jan 15 11:31:00 CST 2007</pubDate><title>Who is God?

That theme is obvious, yet obviously a unique realization that has far-flung impact. That theme is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;God is Spirit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simple, yet subtle. As Jesus said in John 4, God is spirit, so those who worship him must worship him in spirit and truth. Let's follow his argument:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) God is spirit&lt;br /&gt;2) God is primarily concerned with spiritual things&lt;br /&gt;3) God is not concerned with physical things like where the temple is located&lt;br /&gt;4) Worship that God will care about must involve spiritual things, like a person's mind and heart&lt;br /&gt;5) True worshippers must worship God in their spirits, in sincerity&lt;br /&gt;6) The outward actions of temple worship are irrelevant to God&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paul uses this concept as well. God is spirit, so he doesn't distinguish between the various "races" of humanity. He cares about what's inside, not what's outside. God is spirit, so he doesn't see any difference between male and female, Jew and gentile, slave and free. All God sees is the heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's more. Jesus applied the concept to religious authorities. God is spirit, so he doesn't need humans to mediate his presence. Therefore, we should not allow humans to be our "teachers", because we have one teacher; we should not allow humans to be our "masters", because we have one master; we should not allow humans to be our "fathers", because we have one father. Part of the New Covenant, as explained in Hebrews, is that no one will need to be a "teacher" for others, because ALL will know God.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hebrews also brings out another facet of this concept. The blood of bulls and goats, it points out, cannot take away sin. Why? Because God is spirit, and cares nothing for physical blood. As Psalms points out, these bulls and goats are his anyway. What matters is a true sacrifice of spirit, a person submitting themselves to God. That is what Romans 12:1 requires of Christians, and that is EXACTLY what Jesus did. Jesus' physical blood did not cleanse people from sin; Jesus did not physically take his blood to heaven to offer it on an alter (as Hebrews symbolically states); we are never literally washed by Jesus' blood. No; the blood Jesus took to heaven, the blood which purifies us, the sacrifice that takes away the sins of the world, was Jesus' humble submission to God on the cross. It was truly a spiritual sacrifice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is much more here. But now we can see that Paul's opposition to racism, Jesus' opposition to religious hierarchy, the New Testaments' emphasis on spiritual worship, Paul's declaration that male and female are alike to God, and Jesus' approval of all foods, were not just haphazard changes or teachings. They all connect to one central thought, one central realization.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;span class="technoratitag"&gt;Technorati Tags:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/eschatology" target="_blank" rel="tag" title="Link to Technorati Tag category for eschatology"&gt;eschatology&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/theology" target="_blank" rel="tag" title="Link to Technorati Tag category for theology"&gt;theology&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/religion" target="_blank" rel="tag" title="Link to Technorati Tag category for religion"&gt;religion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/spirituality" target="_blank" rel="tag" title="Link to Technorati Tag category for spirituality"&gt;spirituality&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/jesus" target="_blank" rel="tag" title="Link to Technorati Tag category for jesus"&gt;jesus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/christ" target="_blank" rel="tag" title="Link to Technorati Tag category for christ"&gt;christ&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/god" target="_blank" rel="tag" title="Link to Technorati Tag category for god"&gt;god&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/new+testament" target="_blank" rel="tag" title="Link to Technorati Tag category for new testament"&gt;new testament&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/new+covenant" target="_blank" rel="tag" title="Link to Technorati Tag category for new covenant"&gt;new covenant&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2010/08/25/different-kinds-of-mementos/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2010/08/25/different-kinds-of-mementos/</link><pubDate>Wed Aug 25 15:48:16 CDT 2010</pubDate><title>Different kinds of Mementos</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>I tend to collect clutter - a LOT of clutter.

Most of the things I collect fall under the broad category of "mementos", and I keep them for that reason - to remind me of things I've long forgotten, to bring to mind friends I haven't seen in years, to help me reconstruct a past that I've never been too good at keeping track of.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, one of the main things that keeps me from throwing things out is an idea that most people would classify as fantasy. I imagine that hundreds of years from now, archaeologists with amazing new technologies will be able to go through the things I've kept, and reconstruct an intensely vivid picture of the 21st century. This makes me hesitant to even throw out things like receipts, or sometimes, pebbles that have somehow made it into my possession. I mean, they can tell where the Shroud of Turin has travelled by analyzing pollen samples, so why not keep a record of my life in small flakes of rock?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, I've been going through a lot of my stuff, and getting rid of things. And having to wrestle with &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; exactly is okay to get rid of has made me realize there are quite different types of mementos. Here are some of them:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Objects with character&lt;/strong&gt;. These are usually related to an intense memory, maybe of an amazing night with friends, maybe of a trip across the country - maybe we stopped at a weird gas station, and one of us happened to see something strange, and pick it up. Maybe we had a conversation about it, maybe we told jokes, maybe that object just reminds me of those people or that place. This object then becomes a kind of totem, accessing memories I wouldn't otherwise be able to pull up. Some of my collection includes a rock that is shaped like an appearance of the Virgin Mary, a golf ball stained by lake water (we hiked into the middle of a lake to find this one), and an Alabama-themed garter from a friend's wedding, that I kept hanging around my rearview mirror for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A small gift from someone&lt;/strong&gt;. These usually come with some guilt - I wouldn't necessarily hang on to this thing, but I'd feel like I was cutting out a small piece of our relationship if I were to get rid of it. These are hard for me to let go of, especially if it was from someone I am no longer around. I'm becoming better at this, however. If the object doesn't fall into the category of "objects with character" as well, then I am more and more able to let this stuff go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A record of my past&lt;/strong&gt;. These things don't have any special meaning to me, but they record an event I may or may not remember. As such, they might be useful in reconstructing when I did a specific thing, went to a specific place, or met a specific person. These are things like movie tickets and receipts and business cards. It's dumb, but I have gas station receipts from years ago, recording trips I don't even recall. My new way of dealing with this is to photograph them, so I keep the record, and then throw the physical item away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best overall approach I've discovered so far is to ruthlessly segment this stuff, based on why and how I value it. I get ziplock bags, write something like "ticket stubs" or "receipts" on each one, and then isolate each type of thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This allows me to easily see the things I need to get rid of, easily store the things I still want to keep, and photograph or record any information I'm trying to preserve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years I've had boxes of these "mementos", collecting dust and doing nothing for me. But when I separate them out, I've discovered that most of them fall into the third category, small things that I held on to in order to record what I was doing. By separating everything by its use, I'm able to deal with each item most efficiently, and it's making a huge difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm getting closer to minimalism every day.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/02/29/morality-rational-and-how-we-shape-meaning-void/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/02/29/morality-rational-and-how-we-shape-meaning-void/</link><pubDate>Wed Feb 29 15:29:57 CST 2012</pubDate><title>The Morality of The Rational, and How We Shape Meaning from The Void</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>I was recently talking to someone about how uncertain everything is.

There are different opinions on everything - from what's &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; happening in politics to the healthiest diet to follow. With so many different opinions, we could easily become overwhelmed, and decide that since we can never really &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt;, we should just stop trying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But of course, life is lived in spite of uncertainty. We trust science until it changes, we trust people until they prove themselves untrustworthy. Things change all the time, but that doesn't stop us from plunging ahead, making our best guesses in the face of the unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of life is an exercise in creating confidence out of uncertainty, distilling meaning from the void.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that means that we human beings have a massive responsibility. We can quite literally make the world mean anything we want it to. In a special sense, we are like gods, writing the world as we see it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That does not mean, however, that we &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; simply craft whatever meaning we want. Some people have taken the uncertainty, and their awareness of their own power, and have written bizarre and horrific interpretations. Others have decided that since there is a void, that they too will become little voids, embracing nihilism, using their power to create only more nothingness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I see things differently. To me, our power is a chance to exercise a morality of truth. We can choose to exercise self-control and integrity as we create meaning. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don't mean simply that we weigh the consequences, for instance, of believing that the holocaust never happened. That's a morality, but a morality about the effects of our beliefs. I'm talking about a morality that pertains to &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; we believe, and how we come to conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientific method is a particularly strong type of such morality. It maintains a very definite understanding of what sorts of things may be said, and to what degrees of certainty. It doesn't allow us to simply say anything we want; it requires us to be very precise, and to only say things that could be verified by others. It is a certain sort of universal equality - an assertion that the truths that matter are discernible from any vantage point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The principles of rational thought are another such morality. There are many more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What all of these have in common is that they require us to sacrifice something. Many people will get into arguments about meaning and truth, and hold onto their positions no matter what. This means that at a certain point, when it suits their purposes, they will abandon rationality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A person of character, in contrast - someone exercising a personal morality of meaning and belief - won't use just any argument that comes to them. Instead, they will constrain themselves, putting forward their beliefs and assertions with integrity, in a humble manner. And when they can't say something within their principles of rationality or science or whatever else, they will not say it. They will allow others to be right, they will allow themselves to be wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We certainly don't &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to act this way. We can absolve ourselves of any constraints on our choices of meaning. We can be right every single time. But to exercise character, responsibility, consideration for others - this is what it is to act like an adult when it comes to interpreting the world. &lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2004/11/16/notice-feature-article-in-the-huntington-herald-dispatch/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2004/11/16/notice-feature-article-in-the-huntington-herald-dispatch/</link><pubDate>Tue Nov 16 04:06:00 CST 2004</pubDate><title>NOTICE - Feature Article in the Huntington Herald-Dispatch</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>On Sunday (November 14th), the Huntington Herald-Dispatch ran a full-size article on the Reddings Brothers in their Life section.

I suppose that's what happens when you stay up until 1am, and get up at 6am two days in a row.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This reminds me of focusing. (Why? Because I'm having such a hard time focusing right now.) I've recently become convinced that if there are things you really want in life, maintaining focus on those things is one of the surest ways to get them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My persistent dream, the one that has been haunting me for years, the one that I've sacrificed most of the stability in my life for, is to be able to be a musician full-time. It sounds bland when I put it that way, but there it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What you don't see in the blandness are the things that come to MY mind when I write that. I imagine sitting up late at night, looking out over the lights of Seattle, knowing full well that I will be looking out over the lights of New York in just a few short days. I imagine waking up at home, knowing that I can spend my day living out my purpose - not another person's purpose for me. I imagine writing a world of new beautiful songs; having the time and energy to spend &lt;span style="font-style:italic;"&gt;all the time&lt;/span&gt; writing like I do &lt;span style="font-style:italic;"&gt;some of the time&lt;/span&gt;...many songs at a time for days on end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are the things I imagine. And I believe that since this is my purpose, it is my duty to focus on this, to clarify it in my mind, to know this dream inside and out, until I can taste it. And when I taste it, then I'll open my eyes and it will be there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, focus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-micah&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2005/05/18/apartment/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2005/05/18/apartment/</link><pubDate>Wed May 18 01:54:00 CDT 2005</pubDate><title>apartment...</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>Still looking for an apartment while staying with a guy I knew from school.

But those designations aren't really important. The important word is &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;shallow&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would have been easy for me to accept the religious perspective I was handed, as it was. I would have done what was needed to stay out of hell, would have understood what check-marks I needed to check, and that would have been it. And then I would have set out to make my life as thoroughly secular as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With nothing deeper than &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;staying out of hell&lt;/span&gt;, no actual interest in religion or Jesus or God would have been needed - and there would have been no reason or &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;room&lt;/span&gt; to be interested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But my life didn't work out that way. From early on, I knew there was a space - sometimes big, sometimes small - between what my parents thought and what the church was teaching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The religion that the church taught me was bland, uninteresting, extremely shallow, and held no significance whatsoever. It did not inspire great things, it did not provoke great dreams, it did not ask for anything except a narrow understanding of "moral living", and a basic set of religious rituals to perform on weekends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead, it sunk me in a mire of depression. All I could see was the ignorance and shallowness of those around me. And those were the people held up as models for us to aspire to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But my parents created a space between what I was hearing in the church, and what they thought. And that space became a bigger space in my mind between the church's religion and what was &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;real&lt;/span&gt;. That space became a crack of light, through which I saw &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;hope&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of that space, I never saw Christianity as the rituals, traditions, prejudice, and shallowness of the churches I was in. Instead, I saw it as something beautiful and transcendent, something far removed from anything I knew. And I began my search for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stuck in the hopelessness of my surroundings, I saw Christianity as the one thing that could transform my life. Somehow, Christianity held out the possibility of being free, of becoming better than what my surroundings had prepared me to be, of living a meaningful and fulfilled and dramatic life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked to Christianity for &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;transformation&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel like Paul, saying "not that I have already attained..."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this hope is the one fuel that has driven my life. I live like I do because I believe there is something beautiful and transcendent hidden away in the teachings of Jesus - hidden only because our religious traditions have clouded our minds. I live like I do because I want to attain to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I only hold out that hope because a long time ago, my parents subtly demonstrated that Christianity is not what the church told me it was.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2011/08/31/protocols-files/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2011/08/31/protocols-files/</link><pubDate>Wed Aug 31 00:46:50 CDT 2011</pubDate><title>Protocols: Files</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>I've decided to begin putting down my own personal approaches to things as "protocols", both for myself, and for anyone who might derive some utility from this bizarre practice.

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;By default, all file names are structured like this: 20xx-xx-xx filename.txt&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tags may be added: 20xx-xx-xx TAGINCAPS filename.txt&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Projects are grouped together in a small, flat folder structure. In this case, the file naming gets transferred to the folder: 20xx-xx-xx Project Name&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;File Formats:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Should be kept to a minimum. Use plain .txt for everything possible - .rtf after that.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If it's a music file, it should ideally be in lossless AIFF or mp3.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Todo lists are kept in plain .txt, but can be viewed and edited through Taskpaper.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Similarly, use Markdown if possible.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Try to replace Excel with CSV, where possible. Barring that, use Google Docs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Photos:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use Picasa to import (doesn't lock in your files)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;create a folder for that import (20xx-xx-xx picasa), and tell Picasa to import to that folder BY DATE TAKEN&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;this will create folders inside with each day photos were taken, and will contain the photos themselves a further layer down.&lt;/li&gt;

I started thinking about how we approach the raw materials of the world around us, how we think about creativity, and how we deal with our own limitations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But one of the most profound things I noticed about the movie was how it addressed what I like to call “the Matrix problem”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In case you haven’t thought much about the Matrix lately, let me recap the storyline. A group of individuals discover that their world is not the ultimate reality, but is in fact constructed by powerful non-human beings. This discovery frees them to bend and to ultimately break the rules of the world they know. Realizing that they are living in a false reality, they escape to the real world, and set about destroying the world they left behind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a powerful story, and has been told in some form for thousands of years. And on the surface, the Lego Movie tells a story that sounds a lot like this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Near the climax of the movie, Emmet (the main Lego character) falls out of the world he knows — a world composed entirely of Lego bricks — and finds himself in the real world of children and adults, where Legos are just toys, and his whole life has existed on a table in somebody’s basement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I call this the Matrix moment of the movie, because just like in the Matrix, it is this discovery of the outside world that enables the hero to acquire spectacular powers. In discovering that his world is constructed, he can escape the limitations that it seems to impose, and write his own set of rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emmet returns to the Lego world, able to see the world around him in a completely different way. He can now create or build absolutely anything. There is no limit to his ability, because his mind has been opened, his imagination has been engaged, and his creativity has been unleashed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this is where the Matrix and the Lego Movie diverge. In the Matrix, the discovery that the world is constructed leads to a rejection and nullification of the world. The heroes of the Matrix look upon the simulated world of the Matrix as unreal, a trap, a tool of enslavement. As they see things, true freedom can only be had by considering the world an evil to be escaped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in the Lego Movie, discovering that the world is constructed doesn’t lead to a rejection of the world. The heroes of the Lego Movie don’t see their constructed world as a trap or tool of enslavement. Instead, they consider it a gift, an offer of the chance to engage in further creation and construction and play. Realizing that the world is constructed doesn’t lead to rejection or nullification of the world, but to the embrace of the world in a more free and playful manner. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, realizing that the world is created leads to the realization that they too can create things, and participate in the ongoing act of creation going on around them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a huge difference between the Matrix and the Lego Movie. And these two story lines represent two different theologies. Traditionally, the theology of the Matrix has been identified with gnosticism, and the theology of the Lego Movie has been identified with orthodox Christianity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The theology of the Matrix is incredibly compelling, because it answers to all the tensions we feel in the world. When we feel dissatisfied, oppressed, or unhappy, this is easy to account for: the world is evil, a prison designed to keep us in chains. Our aim should be to escape it, and if escape proves difficult, our aim should be to reject it and to distance ourselves from it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The theology of the Lego Movie is ultimately more difficult to wrestle with. Because we have embraced the world as good, we are left with tough questions as to why it is sometimes so screwed up. If the world is good, why are we unhappy or dissatisfied or oppressed? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lego Movie theology forces us to confront the world as it is. If we see something wrong or bad, we can’t just reject the world in which we find ourselves, dismissing the whole thing as evil. Instead, we have to start with the premise that the world is good, and ask ourselves what has gone wrong within it — and what we can do to fix it. This is a tougher task, because answers are not always easy, and problems are not always quickly solved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this is the theology I am drawn towards. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It suggests embrace, rather than rejection, of what we know. It suggests playfulness and creativity rather than cynical detachment. It suggests participation with the creators, rather than waging war on their creations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those of us who suspect that our world is, in fact, constructed, seeing that as an invitation to open-ended play and creation makes all the sense in the world.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2007/04/29/scarcity-vs-abundance/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2007/04/29/scarcity-vs-abundance/</link><pubDate>Sun Apr 29 00:41:00 CDT 2007</pubDate><title>Scarcity vs. Abundance</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>I am troubled by the rise of the belief in the "closed system".As I see it, the world and the universe are an "open system".

We are not defined by a limited set of alternatives and resources available. We are not locked into a future of repetition. But this is what the "closed system" would have you believe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have seen it in economics: the theory that there are only a limited number of jobs available, and they must be distributed equitably.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have seen it in people's opinions about children: "your family is taking up more than your share of space, aren't they?"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have seen it in people's feelings about the earth: "if we use up all of the oil, our children will live in poverty."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This world-view ultimately leaves us bitter and selfish, because it forces us to see our lives as "us vs. them". If a rich person has money, I lack money. If I want food, I have to take it from someone else. If I want a job, you can't have one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What this world-view lacks is perspective, and an understanding of where things come from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Natural resources are NOT finite.&lt;br /&gt;Wealth is NOT finite.&lt;br /&gt;Space is NOT finite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does this seem to fly in the face of science? Consider money, as crass as that may be. Where does it come from?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As economists know, money is just a representation of value, and value comes from the natural world. We plant seeds (which come from the natural world), and we harvest food. Food = wealth. Food = money. We trade food to our neighbors, and our neighbors in turn give us the products that they have created from natural resources.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this system, no one suffers due to another. When we trade, no one loses. Both win.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How do we increase our wealth? Work harder, producing more food? Or work more creatively, producing more food? Humanity has chosen the latter, using technology to get more and more out of less and less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thus our wealth is not limited by our natural resources, but by our creativity. Apply more creativity, and more wealth is available for all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When we consider that the amount of the earth's resources that we are tapping don't extend more than a few miles down, and that our creativity is only beginning to be explored, and that the sky above us holds INFINITELY more resources than our earth does, we begin to realize that our world is anything but a closed system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;God created us to live in an abundant universe. He created the world to be an abundant place, and he created us to look beyond the earth and see the sky above, waiting for us to embrace it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What this means to me is that the universe is literally an infinite store of resources for humanity. Most people would find the "literally infinite" part hard to swallow, so let's just accept that at the moment, it's practically infinite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This means that we live in an open system, not a closed system. And it means that God, and the universe, is good.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2010/02/08/the-many-great-commissions/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2010/02/08/the-many-great-commissions/</link><pubDate>Mon Feb 08 22:03:32 CST 2010</pubDate><title>The Many &amp; Great Commissions</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>People throughout the scriptures receive a call - a mission that infuses their life with purpose, and compels them through danger, sacrifice, and doubt to reach the ends to which they have been driven...</description><content:encoded>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;People throughout the scriptures receive a call - a mission that infuses their life with purpose, and compels them through danger, sacrifice, and doubt to reach the ends to which they have been driven. Standing at the edge of a new world, Jesus issued just such a call to his disciples: to go into the entire world, proclaiming his message to all creation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We've labeled this the "Great Commission", and applied it as a blanket prescription for all Christians for all time. But in doing so, we've made it so general, so toothless, that it means almost nothing. In the modern world, it serves mainly as a tool for raising money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The people who received this commission didn't take it generally. They dropped what they had, sacrificed their possessions and their lives, and went into the entire known world, fiercely spreading the message they had seen with their own eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, people often take "go into all the world" to mean "be where you are in a specific part of the world". But that's not how the first disciples took it; they actually went.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By making this into a general command to be achieved by the community as a whole, we've not only robbed this passage of its meaning, we've robbed ourselves of the ability to receive our own commissions - calls that are far more specific and engaging and dangerous, calls that involve us in bigger and better stories, and calls that make meaning out of who we are as individuals.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/02/14/solipsists-fallacy/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/02/14/solipsists-fallacy/</link><pubDate>Tue Feb 14 10:13:56 CST 2012</pubDate><title>The Solipsist's Fallacy</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>Solipsism is the belief that you can never truly know if anyone else is *real*.

It's what Descartes was trying to get around when he wrote "I think therefore I am", though that may in fact be the purest expression of solipsism ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The argument is simple. I know that I am aware and conscious. I have internal experiences, real feelings, emotions and desires and thoughts. But there is no way to tell if the people around me are experiencing the same things. They may &lt;em&gt;tell&lt;/em&gt; me they are thinking and feeling, but I have no way to confirm that. They may be saying and doing all the things I expect people to say and do, but never actually be conscious, never actually feel or think anything at all. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Science illustrates this vividly. After all, we can dissect a person's brain, but we can't &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt; consciousness, we can't determine whether there are actual thoughts or feelings there. No matter how far we unravel the circuitry of a person's brain, we'll never be able to discover if they actually &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; anything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only way we can know consciousness is from the inside. And so we'll never know if anyone else has it. In the end, we might very well be alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Absurd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This whole thought process comes from a mistaken distinction between &lt;em&gt;being&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;experience&lt;/em&gt;. We assume that we can separate our experience of a person from the actual existence of that person. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be fair, consciousness tends to support that illusion. After all, it erects a wall between us and the world, so that behind that wall, we may have thoughts and conversations with ourselves that no one else can see.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this is a bit like being able to lift the hood of your own car, but being unable to lift the hood of anyone else's car. Just because you can't &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt; anyone else's motor, doesn't mean they don't have one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, if you began to question whether or not all the cars around you had motors in them, we'd think you were crazy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of &lt;em&gt;course&lt;/em&gt; all the cars have motors. We can tell there are motors because the cars are actually &lt;em&gt;moving&lt;/em&gt;. We can see the exhaust, we can see them fueling up, we can watch the way they operate, and how fast they can go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But", you argue, "Maybe they just &lt;em&gt;seem&lt;/em&gt; to have motors in them!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not possible. By definition, working cars have motors. The fact that they move means there is a motor. It might be a small motor, it might be an electric motor - but it's still a motor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You might bring in an ultra-small car. "Look!" you say, "There's no room for a motor!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It doesn't matter. I may not know where it is, or where it fits, but I know there's a motor. If it runs, it has a motor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Not this one!" you say. "This car doesn't have a motor! See, it just has this bucket of fuel, and that bucket drains into this little cup, and that cup periodically ignites and makes the whole thing move forward!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is a motor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It may be a weird motor. You may be able to explain the whole process without ever using the word "motor". But it's a motor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, admittedly, sometimes it's hard to tell if a car has a motor in it. A car might be moving so slowly, it's hard to tell if it's running at all. But if it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; working, then it has a motor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same thing is true when it comes to human consciousness. If a human being &lt;em&gt;acts&lt;/em&gt; like they are conscious, then they &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; conscious. I don't have to figure out where that consciousness comes from, how it works, or where it is "stored". I don't have to understand what's going on "behind the scenes". If it moves, it has a motor. If it communicates, it has consciousness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is exactly how we operate in normal life. None of us carry around a ghostbusters-like "consciousness detector", to pick out conscious beings from non-conscious beings. Instead, we simply &lt;em&gt;interact&lt;/em&gt; - and in that interaction, we know that the being on the other end is like us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no deep divide between experience and being. And so, we are not alone.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/what-would-you-have-done/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/what-would-you-have-done/</link><pubDate>Tue Feb 07 13:01:23 CST 2017</pubDate><title>What would you have done?</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>I’ve spent my entire life wondering what I would do at certain junctures in history.

Would I have followed Jesus—or stood with the Pharisees? Would I have worked against slavery—or argued that it was a necessary evil? Would I have opposed the Nazis, or sat by while they carted away my Jewish neighbors?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The more I’ve thought about it, the more it’s clear to me that I have no way of knowing. Statistically speaking, I would have gone with the Pharisees, and the pro-slavery plantation owners, and the passive Germans who closed their curtains and tidied their kitchens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After all, there were no signs that dropped from the sky and said, “This is it! You’ve finally let things go too far! You’re now the bad guys!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And history doesn’t repeat itself, so there’s no real help that way either. When Nazis came to power, no German had ever lived through the holocaust, or World War 2—so they had no obvious indicators that this was going to end up being one of the most notorious moments in history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I don’t trust myself to see the answer in my own socio-political analysis of the outside world. Millions of brilliant people missed those cues—and I don’t have any reason to think I’d be different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what I &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; do, I think, is deeply examine my principles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Jesus came around, preaching something totally unheard of and unprecedented—how could I have determined that he was actually speaking the truth? How could I have determined that the trusted religious leaders of my people were actually in the wrong?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When pro-slavery and anti-slavery advocates both quoted the Bible, and science, and all the rest—how could I have determined which one was right? When the pro-slavery groups argued that it was a “necessary evil” or “for their own good” or “needed for the security of our society”—how could I have determined that they were arguing in favor of evil, and not reason?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When fascist regimes were spreading disinformation, manipulating the public into believing lies—how could I have ascertained the truth? When they kept pushing the public, inch by inch, down a slippery slope of accepting more and more evils—how could I have known not to buy into it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are the tests by which I refine and develop my principles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If it would have worked then—when all my Biblical interpretation was telling me to reject Jesus, to endorse slavery, to praise Hitler from the pulpit—&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If it would have worked then—when all my instincts were telling me to go with the flow, to endorse things I had formerly been against, to support injustices and oppression—&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If it would have worked then—when all the information I was hearing told me everyone &lt;em&gt;else&lt;/em&gt; was deluded, and had no insight of value—&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then it might be a principle worth having. It might be a principle that could guide me into the future, into whatever situation I might face. It might be a principle that was worth sacrificing for, or living for, or dying for.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2004/12/04/new-buttons-again/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2004/12/04/new-buttons-again/</link><pubDate>Sat Dec 04 07:38:00 CST 2004</pubDate><title>New Buttons Again!</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>Our new Polar Bear and Redding Brothers buttons have arrived!

But sometimes other moments help us see that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At one point in my life I was extremely distressed. I walked out into the darkness, and eventually laid down behind an old log. And I wailed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I couldn't fathom why life was so terrible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Years later, I wrote songs about that night. Those emotions were available to me, allowing me to create things that were new and amazing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The funny thing about a song is that (if it's a good one) there is nothing you would trade it for. Once that song exists, you would never want to go back and undo the experiences that lead up to it. No matter how bad those experiences were.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I feel the same way about that night. There is something there that I wouldn't give up. Not because it turned into something positive - though that helps us see its value - but because in that moment itself, there was something worth its existence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think there's a deeper beauty underneath the pain we encounter. I think it permeates our lives. And I think we can always see it if we look. Positive things may happen, but those things really only highlight what was there to begin with: the deep, underlying beauty in even our most painful moments.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2014/08/28/why-im-conservative-fundamentalist-liberal-progressive/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2014/08/28/why-im-conservative-fundamentalist-liberal-progressive/</link><pubDate>Thu Aug 28 09:23:48 CDT 2014</pubDate><title>Why I’m a Conservative Fundamentalist Liberal Progressive</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>**I’m a conservative** in that I know the world is complex, and I know that simplistic and feel-good solutions don't often fix things.

I look for the &lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/01/31/vast-economy"&gt;mechanisms&lt;/a&gt; that make the world go. I know there is a deep wisdom in the way things &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt;, and I’m skeptical of efforts to overthrow and replace things haphazardly or willy-nilly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m a fundamentalist&lt;/strong&gt; in that I look for absolute principles upon which I can base my life and my action. Like axioms in geometry, I eliminate any principles that are not absolute or that do not scale. And then I try to live by &lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/01/19/i-am-more-fundamentalist-you"&gt;those&lt;/a&gt; principles, as consistently as I possibly can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m a liberal&lt;/strong&gt; in that I care deeply about humanity and the world and life in general. Compassion &lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/2013/08/06/law-christ"&gt;is&lt;/a&gt; my highest value, and I see no justification for the vast amount of violence still lingering in the world, nor for the needless deaths that happen every year due to political machinations and corruption. I cannot justify laws that sacrifice lives to enforce some arbitrary value system or code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m a progressive&lt;/strong&gt; in that I believe in the advancement of human equality, human rights, and human freedom. I believe humanity must move forward, and neither tradition nor vested power should &lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/2013/05/28/poison-empires"&gt;stand&lt;/a&gt; in its way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why did I write this? You might think it is because I believe there should be no differences between us — that, really, all of these categories are the same. But that’s incorrect — I think legitimate and healthy disagreement is essential. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But disagreement only works when it is real, when there are different viewpoints being presented in a robust and thorough way. And unfortunately, the vast majority of debate and argument I see in the world is not that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, I see caricatures of opposing viewpoints. I see people mocking the other side. I see people comparing each other to Hitler, or implying some connection between a sincere expression of opinion and all the murders committed in history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That helps nobody. We only learn from each other when we are open to seeing the value in other viewpoints. We only learn from each other when we are open to being challenged. We only learn from each other when we can say:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Here’s my viewpoint. It probably sounds crazy, and I understand why you would reject it. But here are the reasons it makes sense to me.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or even better:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I don’t agree with your viewpoint, and that might mean I don’t understand it well enough. Can you explain more?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we’re able to do that — to have open and honest discussion, debate, disagreement — then we will grow as individuals, as a culture, as a society. We will all benefit, ideas will flow freely, and people will be willing to listen to what we have to say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Agree or disagree? :)&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2005/03/25/april-16th-brickhouse-show-in-planning/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2005/03/25/april-16th-brickhouse-show-in-planning/</link><pubDate>Fri Mar 25 18:35:00 CST 2005</pubDate><title>April 16th BRICKHOUSE SHOW in planning!</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>We are officially putting on a show at...The Brickhouse (52 Old Main St, St. Albans, WV)Saturday, April 16th6:00pmTentative Lineup is:-Vintage Tone-Fletcher's Grove-The Jiants-One Last Call-The Reddin...</description><content:encoded>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;We are officially putting on a show at...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Brickhouse (52 Old Main St, St. Albans, WV)&lt;br /&gt;Saturday, April 16th&lt;br /&gt;6:00pm&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tentative Lineup is:&lt;br /&gt;-Vintage Tone&lt;br /&gt;-Fletcher's Grove&lt;br /&gt;-The Jiants&lt;br /&gt;-One Last Call&lt;br /&gt;-The Redding Brothers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tickets are $6 in advance, $7 at the door.

The idea is to see if we can construct a minimal theological starter kit, using only reasonable assumptions. The first entry is about &lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/minimum-viable-theology-good-wins"&gt;why good wins&lt;/a&gt;. You should start there.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most controversial features of traditional religion is the belief in creatures outside the bounds of normal organic life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve already written about why we should probably assume that &lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/minimum-viable-theology-we-are-not-alone"&gt;we are not alone&lt;/a&gt;, that there are superhuman beings out there. But religion usually assumes more than just beings &lt;em&gt;out there&lt;/em&gt;—it also assumes that there are significant beings right &lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt;, engaged in our world and in human life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where we normally categorize the organic world into humans, animals, plants, and so on, religions often regale us with menageries of angels, demons, gods, goddesses, ghosts, spirits, souls, and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is one of the factors that makes many people consider religion a form of superstition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It may surprise you to know that the first person who showed me this religious perspective was &lt;em&gt;true&lt;/em&gt; is Richard Dawkins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What is a Meme?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his seminal 1976 book &lt;a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Selfish-Gene-Anniversary-Landmark-Science/dp/0198788606/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1518106397&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+selfish+gene&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=micahredding-20&amp;linkId=f2daf3f36ff28cfdbd2abf39764a501c"&gt;The Selfish Gene&lt;/a&gt;, Richard Dawkins coined the term “meme”. Although “meme” is now used as a term for photos with funny captions, the original concept was far broader, referring to any idea, term, or sound that can be spread from person to person. Dawkins was making the point that genes weren’t the only things which could spread virally and organically and &lt;em&gt;selfishly&lt;/em&gt;—anything capable of being replicated, and influencing its own replication, would behave in the same way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dawkins’ idea was both insightful and prophetic. The term “meme” itself spread from person to person, evolving and adapting as it did so, until it came to be a label for the whole genre of photos mentioned above. In a sense, Dawkins’ term had taken on a life of its own, leaping the fence of academic literature, and finding its way into the much more lucrative ecological niche of social media. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As someone once said, “&lt;a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/IL1sMUfQVRNFC/giphy.gif"&gt;Life finds a way&lt;/a&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These days, the concept of an idea or an image going “viral”, or a tune becoming an “earworm”, is commonplace. We increasingly use organic language to talk about the contents of human communication. But when Dawkins first proposed the idea, it probably seemed pretty counter-intuitive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dawkins’ key insight was that ideas are shaped by the same evolutionary forces that shape infectious viruses. Just as the viruses that spread best are the ones which manipulate their hosts into coughing or sneezing (so as to infect other people in the vicinity), the ideas that spread best are the ones which convince their hosts to spread them to others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Old-fashioned chain letters are a great example of this. They use fear, coercion and a promised reward to convince you to make a copy and send them on. The chain letters which do the best job manipulating their recipients get passed on more often. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The examples needn’t be negative. “Science” and “rationality” are also memes, which spread from person to person. They spread because they seem compelling and truthful to us, and because they also work to spread lots of evidence about how effective they are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key thing is that ideas don’t spread purely because they are better ideas. Their effectiveness and truthfulness may help them spread—but ultimately those factors are part of a bigger picture. The ideas that spread best, are the ones that do the best job convincing their hosts to spread them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The Hidden Ecosystem&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dawkins hadn’t simply coined a clever term. In showing us the organic behavior of ideas, he had thrown open the door to a whole new ecosystem. Just as our bodies play host to billions of tiny creatures living in symbiotic (and sometimes parasitic) union with us, our minds play host to billions of tiny creatures as well. And those creatures are the base layer of an entire ecosystem which stretches far beyond the individual human mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the first things people realized in grappling with this new science of “memetics” was that memes can work together symbiotically, creating larger entities called “memeplexes”. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an example, the concept of “rationality” is made more convincing and easier to transmit by the partner concept of “superstition”. Contemplating the negative connotations of “superstition” makes you want to look for a positive alternative, and identifying the positives of “rationality” makes you want to warn people of the negatives of “superstition”. These two terms can do better together, working to reinforce each other—and in fact, a whole host of related terms often travel along with them, as you’ve seen in this post already: science, truth, evidence, effectiveness, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Memeplexes don’t stop there. Perhaps the most controversial topic in memetics is the study of religion. Religions are memeplexes &lt;em&gt;par excellence&lt;/em&gt;, vast ecosystems of cooperating and symbiotic memes, containing ideas, stories, philosophies, songs, art, and literature—all working together to perpetuate themselves and each other, as these memeplexes keeps growing and evolving over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some religious people may find it troubling to look at things this way. But memetics tells us nothing about truth or falsehood—it shows us how things grow. Just as it is useful to consider how science and rationality spread from person to person, it is illuminating to consider how religions are passed on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Memeplexes don’t simply spread themselves as ideas. They also tend to generate effects in the physical world. Religious memeplexes build temples, scientific memeplexes create technologies, technological and aesthetic memeplexes build cars, clothes, iPhones, and factories. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kevin Kelly calls this &lt;a href="http://amzn.to/2Eq2XX4"&gt;the technium&lt;/a&gt;, the entire ecosystem of art and technology and cultural products. Kevin sees this as a seventh kingdom of life, whose genes consists of our ideas, and whose bodies consists of our tools. Just as the biological creatures we’re familiar with start as genes that produce bodies, and those bodies help spread their genes—creatures of the technium start as ideas that produce artifacts, and those artifacts help spread the ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there is more to the technium than just products and artwork and artifacts. There are other systems that grow up from the seeds of memeplexes, and become vast organisms that live in and among human societies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Corporations, for instance. They are born, they grow, they die. They breath in and out, they consume and excrete. They’ve even convinced us to legally classify them as persons, possessing rights normally only associated with human beings. Charlie Stross has recently called them &lt;a href="http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2018/01/dude-you-broke-the-future.html"&gt;the first AI&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where did they come from? The seed of an idea—a meme—that mutated and spread until it attracted other memes, and became a memeplex. That memeplex allowed the creation of systems of human order and operation, organizing us around the processing of money and materials. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These organisms have their own impulses and needs. Even in a legal sense, the operators of a corporation are not free to make their own decisions—they are legally bound to make money, to feed and grow the corporation to the best of their ability. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Corporations are only one example. In reality, all organizations are some species of this kind. Next time you curse at a bureaucracy, remember that you’re really cursing at a non-human species that is using human faces to communicate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, corporations and institutions and organizations can only exist because there are legal and political systems in which they live and move and have their being. These legal and political systems are themselves creatures, born of memeplexes, grown into widespread systems of human behavior, occupying vast space in human minds and homes, consuming huge quantities of energy and upkeep, exclusively operating and possessing large amounts of the real estate on this planet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re still only scratching the surface of the organisms that live among us and in us. Riots are a kind of viral contagion that break out, then quickly dissipate, leaving many people feeling like their minds have been possessed. They act as mental infections spread from person to person, leading to emergent behaviors in concert with other infected individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the contagion is intentional. This is the concept of the “&lt;a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2016/12/01/a-pseudoethnography-of-egregores/"&gt;Egregore&lt;/a&gt;”—an autonomous entity made up of, and influencing, the thoughts of a group of people. Thus, a group of people may consciously or unconsciously come together to incarnate a god or a demon. If that is what some people play at in party games and seances, it may be what others accomplish in a more substantial way, given more concerted efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of these things—mobs, markets, political systems, cities, bureaucracies, institutions—are creatures which spread themselves across multiple human hosts, and which sustain themselves by drawing on and controlling human attention and effort. Walter Wink called them &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Powers-That-Be-Theology-Millennium/dp/0385487525/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=micahredding-20&amp;linkId=ef0d2bb829b38d017c2bd4811058a719"&gt;the powers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I call them &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2016/02/11/minimum-viable-superorganism/"&gt;Superorganisms&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These superorganisms are mostly invisible, and yet exert incredible power and influence in human life. They can possess people, changing them dramatically—sometimes temporarily, sometimes permanently. They can war with each other, they can be killed, they can be cast out. They can be healthy or diseased, benevolent or destructive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Struggling with these superorganisms is not like fighting other human beings. Just as trying to contain a meme usually makes it spread faster, trying to destroy diseased and destructive superorganisms through conventional means almost always backfires. To fight these entities, we need new and different approaches. One of these approaches might be to sustain and grow benevolent superorganisms, which can fight destructive superorganisms on their own turf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least one religion has the explicit aim of forming such a superorganism, grown from the voluntary efforts and sacrifices of large numbers of humans, across numerous generations. We Christians call this &lt;em&gt;The Body of Christ&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Superorganisms Among Us&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;That we live in a world of superorganisms is not a new realization. It is perhaps one of the oldest ones—a realization that must have dawned as early humanity grappled with the forces unleashed through emerging self-awareness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like the birth of the internet, it suddenly seemed as if viruses were everywhere. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea that a human could be possessed by some rogue entity was not hypothetical, it was obvious. The idea that tribes and kingdoms were driven by a non-material dimension of life, was the height of practicality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The concept that healthy human life required some kind of “anti-virus”, and meant engaging in some kind of non-material warfare, erecting non-material defenses, using non-material weapons, made all the sense in the world. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If early human societies had clumsy ideas about how to go about this, that does not invalidate their realizations. The fact that we’re still struggling with these problems in the age of social media, demonstrates just how difficult they are to solve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These issues aren’t going away. If anything, they’re likely to become more pressing, and more dramatic over time. To deal with them, we’re going to have to embrace the fact that we live in a world haunted by non-human forces, an ecosystem of invisible beings that shape every aspect of our lives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re going to have to accept that there are superorganisms among us.&lt;/p&gt;

What is the 9th of Av? Most importantly, it is the date of the Destruction of both the First and Second Jewish Temples. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mishnah" title="Mishnah"&gt;Mishnah&lt;/a&gt; (_&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taanit" title="Taanit"&gt;Taanit&lt;/a&gt;_, 4:6), five specific events occurred on the ninth of Av that warrant fasting:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;On this day, the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shlach#The_scouts" title="Shlach"&gt;twelve scouts&lt;/a&gt; sent by &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses" title="Moses"&gt;Moses&lt;/a&gt; to observe the land of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canaan" title="Canaan"&gt;Canaan&lt;/a&gt; returned from their mission. Two of the scouts, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua" title="Joshua"&gt;Joshua&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caleb" title="Caleb"&gt;Caleb&lt;/a&gt;, brought a positive report, but the others spoke disparagingly about the land which caused the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children_of_Israel" title="Children of Israel"&gt;Children of Israel&lt;/a&gt; to cry, panic and despair of ever entering the "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promised_Land" title="Promised Land"&gt;Promised Land&lt;/a&gt;". For this, they were punished by God that their generation would not enter the land and when their descendants would do so under &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua" title="Joshua"&gt;Joshua’s&lt;/a&gt; leadership, they would have to wage wars in order to possess it. Because of the Israelites' lack of faith, God decreed that for all generations this date would become one of crying and misfortune for their descendants, the Jewish people. (See &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Numbers" title="Book of Numbers"&gt;Numbers&lt;/a&gt; Ch. 13–14)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The First Temple built by &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon" title="Solomon"&gt;King Solomon&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Judah" title="Kingdom of Judah"&gt;Kingdom of Judah&lt;/a&gt; were destroyed by the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonia" title="Babylonia"&gt;Babylonians&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebuchadrezzar_I" title="Nebuchadrezzar I"&gt;Nebuchadnezzar&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/586_BC" title="586 BC"&gt;586 BCE&lt;/a&gt; and the Judeans were sent into the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonian_captivity" title="Babylonian captivity"&gt;Babylonian exile&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The Second Temple was destroyed by the Romans in &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/70_AD" title="70 AD"&gt;70 CE&lt;/a&gt; scattering the people of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judea" title="Judea"&gt;Judea&lt;/a&gt; and commencing a two thousand year &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_diaspora" title="Jewish diaspora"&gt;Jewish exile&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_Kokhba%27s_revolt" title="Bar Kokhba&amp;#39;s revolt"&gt;Bar Kokhba's revolt&lt;/a&gt; against Rome failed, and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_bar_Kokhba" title="Simon bar Kokhba"&gt;Bar Kokhba&lt;/a&gt; was killed, and the city of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betar_%28fortress%29" title="Betar (fortress)"&gt;Betar&lt;/a&gt; was destroyed.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Following the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Jerusalem_%2870%29" title="Siege of Jerusalem (70)"&gt;Siege of Jerusalem&lt;/a&gt;, the subsequent razing of Jerusalem occurred one year later.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talmud" title="Talmud"&gt;Talmud&lt;/a&gt; in tractate &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taanit" title="Taanit"&gt;Taanit&lt;/a&gt;, the destruction of the Second Temple began on the ninth and was finally consumed by the flames the next day on the Tenth of Av.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(source: &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tisha_B%27Av"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The significance of this date is interesting. As I recall from reading Josephus, he too attached great meaning to the fact that both temples fell on the 9th of Av. This was indication that the nature of both destructions was the same: judgment from God.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, to me, the events of 70 CE (and events 3-5 above) are the most interesting, because I see these events as the DIRECT fulfillment of the prophecies of Jesus' &lt;em&gt;Parousia&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;Appearing&lt;/em&gt;, commonly known as the Second Coming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many see this day as a day of mourning; but Christians can see it as the day on which Jesus removed all physical barriers to the Presence of God, and brought all humanity out of the shadow of death into the grace of God.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contrary to some assumptions, Jews are not in any kind of 2000-year exile. Instead, ALL of humanity has been made whole before God. Any kind of attempt to re-separate humanity from God by re-instituting animal sacrifices or temples or tabernacles will ultimately fail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that's true whether the person striving to re-institute these things is Christian, Jewish, or Muslim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthodox_Judaism" title="Orthodox Judaism"&gt;Orthodox Jews&lt;/a&gt; believe that until the arrival of the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_Messiah" title="Jewish Messiah"&gt;Jewish Messiah&lt;/a&gt;, this day will continue to be observed as a fast; when the Messiah comes, it will become a great celebration. This notion is asserted on the basis of a passage in the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Zechariah" title="Book of Zechariah"&gt;Book of Zechariah&lt;/a&gt; (8:19) that foretells of the transformation of four fast days into joyous holidays. (source: Wikipedia)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;They look for a time when all fast days will become days of celebration. I think that's beautiful. I also think it's current reality. The time has come. Humanity has moved past the time of fasting and weeping and days of mourning. Any religious belief which postpones humanity's hope to a future date ultimately leaves us unsatisfied and wanting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is another thread of Jewish thought that is particularly interesting here: the belief that the 9th of Av is the birthday of the Jewish Messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are told that Tisha b'Av is the Messiah's birthday, but this may not be his physical birthday. Instead, we can understand this statement in allegoric fashion:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The concepts of Moshiach and Redemption were "born" on Tisha b'Av; as soon as the Holy Temple was destroyed, redemption became a possibility. For if the Jews would have properly repented immediately, Moshiach would have been revealed at that moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the teachings of Chassidut it is explained that the inner purpose of the destruction was so that we should be able to reach much higher spiritual levels with the coming of Moshiach - and this only became possible on Tisha b'Av.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So while today we view Tisha b'Av as a sad and tragic day, in the Messianic Era we will celebrate this day as the "birthday" of the ultimate salvation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(source: &lt;a href="http://www.askmoses.com/article.html?h=110&amp;o=43879"&gt;AskMoses.com&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a beautiful point of view: from the ashes comes even greater glory. We Christians agree that the inner purpose of this destruction was to enable us ALL to reach much higher spiritual levels; indeed, the destruction symbolized that God was through with physical barriers between himself and humanity, at last God and man had become one. The waiting was over, the wedding had come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's hoping more people come to recognize this (and every day) as a day of celebration, instead of a day of mourning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-micah&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2004/10/08/radio-appearance-new-version-of-mr-rogers-available-100704/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2004/10/08/radio-appearance-new-version-of-mr-rogers-available-100704/</link><pubDate>Fri Oct 08 02:31:00 CDT 2004</pubDate><title>Radio appearance!

Since then he has written over 50 songs and won awards for songs he recorded on his CD, The Clearing. His songs run the gamut of human experience and have been compared to the likes of James Taylor and Cat Stevens. One listener was heard to say " So beautiful I can't think!" With a percussive guitar sound and a sweet voice, Scott Maskiell is sure to tweak your heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jon Raven&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Crystal Thomas&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My name is Crystal. I just turned 21 and I breathe chocolate and music.&lt;br /&gt;---&lt;br /&gt;Born in Redlands, California, Crystal Thomas grew up in a musical family and began composing her own songs at the tender age of two. Crystal began seriously developing her own material in 1997.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By 1999, at age 15, Crystal recorded four impressive compositions that led to the involvement of Grammy award-winning songwriter Randy Thomas, as producer and collaborator. These early recordings caught the attention of writer/ producer Steve Diamond and former RCA representative, Teri Muntz, who began grooming Crystal for the pop world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 2002, Crystal moved to Turkey, where she helped develop a curriculum for 5th grade Iraqi children. During her time abroad she was acquainted with the Turkish artisan community, which influenced her both artistically and spiritually. After returning to the states Crystal co-wrote the script and music for the musical, "Evermore: the life of Edgar Allan Poe," which the Frankin Classical Players performed. After meeting with major labels in 2004, Crystal realized she didn't belong with a big label and she, Steve, Teri, and Randy parted ways. Crystal recently returned to Nashville to pursue the music of her heart, while supporting herself as a chocolatier at the Cocoa Tree in Franklin, Tennessee. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crystal’s brand of artistic pop has been received as a musical breath of fresh air. With influences that include Sheryl Crow, Joni Mitchell, Patti Griffin, and Rickie Lee Jones, Crystal’s style defies easy categorization. At 21 years of age, her musical style is surprisingly mature, with lyrics that are simultaneously vulnerable and incisive. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Poised to release her solo debut in 2006, under her label, Merope’s Star Records, Crystal Thomas is an intelligent and soaring musical voice, who explores the complexities of life, love, and the culture in which we live. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.myspace.com/crystalthomas"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.myspace.com/crystalthomas"&gt;http://www.myspace.com/crystalthomas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Seth Harper&lt;/b&gt; is basically new to the Nashville music scene. Sprouting from deep Alabama roots, Seth looks to further a sort of Renaissance for his homeland, keeping his music wide-ranging but at the same time distinctly Southern in delivery. His voice is gritty, yet pleasant, and his songs are honest, yet oddly poetic. He tends to weave tales of weary souls, beautiful women, and second chances, all the while putting on an explicitly spiritual edge. He is still looking for just the right bandmates, but until then he will walk this road all by himself.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2008/09/15/there-no-hell-part-4-scriptures-outer-darkness/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2008/09/15/there-no-hell-part-4-scriptures-outer-darkness/</link><pubDate>Mon Sep 15 10:36:15 CDT 2008</pubDate><title>There Is No Hell (part 4), The Scriptures, Outer Darkness</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>WEEPING AND GNASHING, or WHO TURNED THE LIGHTS OUT?

Matthew 8:11-12 (also Mt 22:13; Mt 25:30; see Mt 13:42,50; Mt 24:51 and Luke 13:28)

"Weeping and gnashing of teeth" is synonymous with "hell" in many people's minds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But let's look beyond the scary words. Those words mean simply this: tears and anger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In context, Jesus was talking about how the centurion showed more faith than anyone in Israel. And he says this to make a statement: the kingdom was being accepted by gentiles (and prostitutes and tax collectors!) before it was being accepted by many of the Jewish leadership.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Jewish leaders placed great value in their heritage from the patriarchs. Being a descendent of Abraham meant you were in the kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But a time would come when they would suddenly realize the kingdom had passed them by, and (being outside the kingdom) they would find themselves separated from the patriarchs they had valued so much. Instead, gentiles would be "feasting with Abraham" in God's kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jesus is simply prophesying that with many of his fellow Jews rejecting him, gentiles were going to be the ones who would accept his message.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who rejected him would find themselves in "outer darkness" (away from the feast and light of God). And they would respond with tears and anger: "weeping" and "gnashing of teeth".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This begins early on, as people reacted to Stephen:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Acts 7:54&lt;br/&gt;Now when they heard this, they were cut to the quick, and they began gnashing their teeth at him.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it only grew more pronounced as Paul stirred up jealously among his people by bringing in the gentiles (Romans 11:14). Paul even gives a side mention of the "outer darkness" that many Jews were experiencing:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Romans 11:7-9&lt;br/&gt;7 What then? What Israel is seeking, it has not obtained, but those who were chosen obtained it, and the rest were hardened; 8 just as it is written, "GOD GAVE THEM A SPIRIT OF STUPOR, EYES TO SEE NOT AND EARS TO HEAR NOT, DOWN TO THIS VERY DAY." 9 And David says, "LET THEIR TABLE BECOME A SNARE AND A TRAP, AND A STUMBLING BLOCK AND A RETRIBUTION TO THEM. 10 "LET THEIR EYES BE DARKENED TO SEE NOT, AND BEND THEIR BACKS FOREVER."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ultimate fulfillment of this was in the destruction of Jerusalem. At that point, many non-Christian Jews suddenly realized that they had missed the Messianic boat. The Messiah was being followed by gentiles from all over the world, but the temple they had built their hopes on was in ruins (just as Jesus said: Matthew 24).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jesus is ALWAYS referring to his own people when he talks about "weeping and gnashing of teeth" and "outer darkness". He never said this would happen to anyone but the people of Israel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The destruction of Jerusalem was a judgment from God. And when it happened, the inhabitants of Jerusalem found themselves outside the kingdom of God, and discovered that it had been given to another people. And they reacted as Jesus said they would: with weeping and gnashing of teeth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The "outer darkness" is directly related to Jesus' idea that he had the light. It is only ever used in specific relation to what would happen to the people of Israel as opposed to what would happen to the gentiles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we wanted to take a different interpretive approach, we could try to connect this "outer darkness vs. feasting with Abraham" story to the Rich man and Lazarus in Hades experiencing "torment vs. Abraham's bosom". That would just strengthen our argument that this is not eternal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Either way, there is nothing permanent about this situation, nothing eternal. You may interpret the passages differently, but the fact is that nothing in here, whether it relates to "outer darkness" or "weeping and gnashing", says anything about eternity. This situation of weeping and gnashing doesn't last forever, because we already know the effect of the Lake of Fire and the Second Death.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2009/10/24/3-things-that-have-inspired-me/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2009/10/24/3-things-that-have-inspired-me/</link><pubDate>Sat Oct 24 21:43:27 CDT 2009</pubDate><title>3 things that have inspired me</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>Just a short list of things that have inspired me to really feel life, even if only briefly.

I'm not sure they're wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though Japan boasts an &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonchurch_Movement"&gt;anti-church Christianity&lt;/a&gt; that has sometimes been claimed to influence as much as 30% of the population, and much of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_house_church"&gt;China's Christianity&lt;/a&gt; is purportedly non-church, and there were no established churches for the first 300 years of Christianity... it is likely that the Western church would fall apart without a strong structural presence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that is exactly why I'm doing what I'm doing. For the foreseeable future, the church in America and in many parts of the world will be losing more and more members every year. And because most of them have been taught that Christianity = Church, many of them will leave the faith as well. This doesn't have to be the case. There are many reasons people leave church, many of which emerge from deep structural and philosophical problems. And most of them have little to do with Christianity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this juncture in history, the way to save Christianity is to establish it outside the camp of traditional christendom. If we are there, we will grow and flourish for a thousand years. If we are not, vast numbers of people will leave forever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-Micah&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2005/01/31/week-in-review/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2005/01/31/week-in-review/</link><pubDate>Mon Jan 31 00:11:00 CST 2005</pubDate><title>Week in Review</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>This weekend, we travelled to Lexington to play at Lock&amp;amp;Key, a cool coffeeshop made out of an old bank.

Most of the old bank furniture was still there, and hanging out in the safe was the coolest part. Then we headed up to Cincinnati to do an in-store at Mediaplay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It snowed all the way home, so it took us longer than usual to get home, but we made it safely. As evidenced by the fact that I'm here to post to this website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, other stuff we've been doing is research and writing for our new magazine (shhhh! It hasn't been announced yet!), which takes a lot of time. But it seems to be shaping up pretty nicely.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This coming Friday, we're playing at &lt;a href="http://www.commongroundsoflexington.com/"&gt;Common Grounds&lt;/a&gt; (a college coffeeshop in Lexington) with &lt;a href="http://www.mikechappelear.com/"&gt;Mike Chappelear&lt;/a&gt;.

Instead, we rehashed our artistic history by playing our songs in the chronological order of when they were written, bringing back a bunch of songs we hadn't sung in years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This show was at the Huntington Borders, and it was a lot of fun for us. The Borders people told us there were 102 people standing around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I got a special present which made this show awesome.

And a small part of those ideas get put into practice, and change things. But most of it goes undone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During the weekend in Atlanta, I attended the APCA conference, lived through a tornado, and set my mind on fire with ideas. Ideas that need DONE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And so in determining to DO things, I've decided that I need to go public with my intentions. I need ideas and help from others, and the ability to bounce my ideas off the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My aim is to do more with my band than just deliver a concert. I want to create an experience, and transcend what bands are "supposed" to do. I want to empower people to turn around and create their own world, rather than being content to consume the one created by what's left of MTV.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm taking baby-steps in that direction already. We're working on partnering with some organizations that are doing important things. We've worked with charities (like the Heifer Project) that we felt were doing something unique and creative in the world. We're moving into concerts that are more meaningful, and are more than just a show.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to make our concerts places where people build spontaneous community, not just an event people watch together. I want our concerts to empower and inspire people to go home and change their life. And I don't mean that in a touchy-feely way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some concerts leave you feeling like you want to quit your job and burn down your house. Not because they make you feel destructive, but because they inspire you with the vision of something bigger and much more amazing that YOU are capable of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to do that. I want to be that band. I want to inspire the next renaissance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's my soul. I want your feedback.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-micah&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2007/03/19/the-awe-of-an-atheist/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2007/03/19/the-awe-of-an-atheist/</link><pubDate>Mon Mar 19 22:45:00 CDT 2007</pubDate><title>The Awe of an Atheist</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>Pedro, over at Way of The Mind (an atheist blog) gave a very insightful post about "awe".

His perspective is that religion could have seized upon the advance of science to display an even more immense, complex God than had ever been imagined by ancient and medieval philosophy. Instead, religion rejected the advances of science, leaving atheistic science with a much bigger universe to be in awe of than is recognized by the religious community.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see this in many cases, and the irony of it is profound. The sense of awe is built on comprehending something large and unfathomable, and this sense is not fed by holding a simplistic view of the cosmos. But for some reason, religion often does hold a simplistic view of the cosmos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My own sense of awe at God is largely built upon a comprehension of just how large the universe is. When you think about the nature of things on the scale of 20 Billion Light Years, and realize how long a Light-Year really is, you begin to get a concept of God that is much more immense than the traditional "guy in the sky".&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, size is just scratching the surface. But Pedro's point is well taken. Cultivate an awareness (both scientific and experiential) of how big and complex the universe is, and you might begin to see God in a different light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-micah&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2008/09/15/there-no-hell-part-6-conclusion/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2008/09/15/there-no-hell-part-6-conclusion/</link><pubDate>Mon Sep 15 15:29:32 CDT 2008</pubDate><title>There Is No Hell (part 6), Conclusion</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>CONCLUSION

I've established that Hades is only temporary, and so the Rich man's torments in Hades were not eternal, but would end in Gehenna. I've established that Gehenna and the Lake of Fire are intended to be understood as complete destruction, the full and final death that only God can deliver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've established that Outer Darkness, whatever it might be, is not eternal either. There is room for the idea of specific punishments for wicked people (either in life, or after death) prior to their complete destruction. But complete destruction is always the end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many other ways we could approach this, from the biblical teaching that man is NOT naturally immortal, to the lack of "hell" in early Christian teaching, to the tons of other verses that state strongly that evil people are not tortured, but destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although I've given only a cursory look at the subject, I am confident that the more in-depth your study goes, the more this view will be confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than holding on to the idea that everyone is immortal, and some get tortured for all eternity, we should follow the bible in affirming that "the wages of sin is DEATH, but the GIFT of God is eternal life". Only God's people get eternal life. Only God's people get immortality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FOR FURTHER STUDY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As biblical scholarship has grown during the past decades, this viewpoint has become increasingly well-accepted within Christianity at large.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reason for this is that the traditional arguments in favor of hell just haven't held up under scrutiny, and trying to ward off biblical arguments by accusing people of being Jehovah's Witnesses just isn't a good long-term way to prove your point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the freedom from historic Christian creeds that exists in the Churches of Christ, this viewpoint has been embraced in recent years by many conservative Church of Christ scholars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;F. LaGard Smith is one very conservative author whose book, "Afterlife", is intended to prove this "annihilationist" belief system. He references other Church of Christ authors who have taught the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I met him while attending Freed-Hardeman University, he had just published "Radical Restoration", in line with much of my thinking. When he later published "Afterlife", I had the odd sensation of feeling like we were tracking down the same biblical lines of thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John Bland, a former Church of Christ preacher, wrote an in-depth paper on the topic, entitled &lt;a href="http://www.friktech.com/rel/hell.htm"&gt;Hell? No!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Homer Hailey from Florida College taught this belief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most notably, Edward Fudge from the Bering Drive Church of Christ in Houston, wrote a book in the early 1990s entitled "The Fire That Consumes".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Fire That Consumes" is recognized among biblical scholars to be the most comprehensive and authoritative book on the subject of "annihilationism" or "conditionalism" ever written.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is a summary of his belief. &lt;a href="http://www.theexaminer.org/volume1/number4/hell.htm"&gt;Part 1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.theexaminer.org/volume1/number6/hell.htm"&gt;Part 2&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where I am only able to deal with some of the issues in a very cursory fashion, Edward Fudge deals with it all in an extremely nuanced and comprehensive way.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2013/01/21/gardeners-stars/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2013/01/21/gardeners-stars/</link><pubDate>Mon Jan 21 00:01:27 CST 2013</pubDate><title>Gardeners of the Stars</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>I hope that one day humanity will assess its gifts, its skills, and its history, and come to the conclusion that our purpose in this world is to cultivate and create life.

This has been with mixed results, but I think at the root of those impulses was the urge to bring more goodness into the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our efforts extended farther. For our entire history, we have been telling each other stories, making up new ones as we went along. People worked hard to come up with new ideas, new thoughts which could be passed on to future generations, built on by their children and grandchildren.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These stories were very much a way of creating new life. New ways of being were born from them, new societies grew from their telling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other humans explored, leaving behind their villages and their cities to plant the seeds for civilization in the deserts and unknown expanses. They crossed seas and mountains, and overcame fears and limitations to reach the places others were afraid to go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether through exploration, agriculture, or story-telling, all humans have tried to create life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hope that we continue that. I hope that society recognizes this as our purpose, and begins to focus our efforts and energies in this one direction. Maybe then war would quiet, maybe the background nihilism of our time would lift, maybe the self-destructive tendencies of the young and old would vanish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if we do embrace this, it will eventually require that we leave our planet. Just like the explorers before us, leaving their homes and villages, we will need to venture out into the universe to plant new worlds. I hope that as we do so, we will bring life where there is none, encourage whatever life we may find, and if we encounter any other sentient beings out there, join with them in cultivating the universe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe there will be planets where we allow whales to flourish and grow, giving them free reign of vast oceans. Maybe there will be planets where we bring back creatures the earth has lost, like the saber-toother tiger or the wooly mammoth. Maybe we will create environments for them, and allow them to live and grow and develop in ways they never had the chance to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe we will watch them from afar, enjoying the experience of each of their beautiful and unexpected lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps hundreds of thousands of years from now, we will be watching over millions of worlds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end, this is the only way to escape turning inward, becoming obsessed with self-gratification, decaying into a futile and worthless species. If we do not go out, if we do not generate, we will become masturbatory and disgusting. And when we can stand ourselves no longer, we will die by our own hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if we do embrace what is out there, all the beauty that is possible, then we will become a species that knows the joy of watching life flourish on massive scales. We will become the parents of worlds, the gardeners of the stars, living in the spaces between, ecstatically watching over all the creatures in our care.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2005/05/18/shows-this-weekend-2/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2005/05/18/shows-this-weekend-2/</link><pubDate>Wed May 18 01:22:00 CDT 2005</pubDate><title>Shows THIS weekend...</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>We've got two shows this weekend...Dayton Borders2040 Miamisburg Centerville Rd.Dayton, OH 45459Phone:937.434.3800...Friday, 8pm...The Attic ClubDayton, OH...Saturday, 8:00pm......</description><content:encoded>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;We've got two shows this weekend...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dayton Borders&lt;br /&gt;2040 Miamisburg Centerville Rd.&lt;br /&gt;Dayton, OH 45459&lt;br /&gt;Phone:937.434.3800&lt;br /&gt;...Friday, 8pm...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Attic Club&lt;br /&gt;Dayton, OH&lt;br /&gt;...Saturday, 8:00pm...&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2006/11/07/furious-pursuit-a-great-book/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2006/11/07/furious-pursuit-a-great-book/</link><pubDate>Tue Nov 07 17:30:00 CST 2006</pubDate><title>Furious Pursuit - a great book</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>Furious Pursuit is a book I just read by Tim King and Frank Martin.

In my estimation, the first century Roman Empire had nearly reached the ultimate level of control over human resources, using the tools of slavery and war and violent domination better than any previous organization in history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this was a dead end. &lt;a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/2013/05/28/poison-empires"&gt;My tendency&lt;/a&gt; is to think that their very success at utilizing the tools of violent power undermined their ability to develop science and technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to get past this log-jam, society would need to develop a sort of individualism, a sense that individual human life was so valuable, it really shouldn’t be sacrificed to the needs of the collective. Most societies have valued the needs of the collective highly enough to justify the killing of innocent people, if that was considered best for society. Humanity needed a sense that individual human life was so valuable, that society really shouldn’t be making those kind of trade-offs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This, in my estimation, is the philosophical core of science. Science does away with communal truth, with things being accepted as fact for the sake of society. Instead, in embracing universal verifiability, it elevates the value of individual perception to the most advanced degree possible. Truth is not something determined by the intellectuals or the elites, it’s something determined through tests — a system that is inherently designed to allow any individual to play the role of truth-finder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So the way I see things, in order for science and technology to take off, the value placed on individual human life had to increase dramatically. In order for this to happen, the Roman Empire as it was had to fall, and a society inspired by new philosophies had to rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, Christianity played that role. In its quite checkered history, it created a crisis in Rome’s existence, and ultimately allowed for the somewhat graceful collapse of the empire, and the rise of a society inspired by a new set of ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t read that as some kind of idealization of the post-renaissance West. Far from it. But the scales did tip, just enough to allow for science to take root. And science was built by increasing the value placed on individual human life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So now we’re facing a future in which machine intelligences will increasingly play a role. And many people have felt, or will feel, as if this is a challenge to the value of human life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The question is, would a different set of philosophies have prepared us better for this future?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Would pantheism, with its sense that consciousness is in all things, have given us better mental tools for understanding machine intelligence? Would paganism, with its sense that spirits might possess anything, have given us better ways of talking about non-human intelligent agents?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don’t know. But I suspect that those philosophies might not have given us the necessary valuation of human life, early enough in history, to have gotten us to this point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That doesn’t mean those philosophies should be downplayed. In fact, if the West gave us the primary tools to reach this level of technological development, perhaps the East will give us the tools to navigate the oncoming technological changes. Perhaps the philosophical East and West are like two batteries powering technological society, and we have reached the point where the primary power source will flip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In any case, I’d be happy to see some of these changes. The philosophy of the West may have provided the needed individualism to kick off modern science, but its assumption of a deep Cartesian divide between mind and body went overboard. Even Christian and Jewish source documents would have found this troubling. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reclaiming a more earthy, holistic, and fluid understanding of consciousness will be advantageous both now and in the oncoming future. And it will ultimately put us in better alignment with both Eastern and Western philosophical traditions.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2005/10/08/2nd-edgehill-studios-showcase/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2005/10/08/2nd-edgehill-studios-showcase/</link><pubDate>Sat Oct 08 16:22:00 CDT 2005</pubDate><title>2nd Edgehill Studios Showcase</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>The Writers Showcase @ Edgehill StudiosTueday, September 25th7:00pm-9:00pmJohn VeLoraBilly SwayzeOriginally from New York, Scott Maskiell began his songwriting career while on a national tour of the r...</description><content:encoded>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;The Writers Showcase @ Edgehill Studios&lt;br /&gt;Tueday, September 25th&lt;br /&gt;7:00pm-9:00pm&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;John VeLora&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Billy Swayze&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Originally from New York, &lt;b&gt;Scott Maskiell&lt;/b&gt; began his songwriting career while on a national tour of the rock musical "Jekyll &amp;amp; Hyde" in 1996. Since then he has written over 50 songs and won awards for songs he recorded on his CD, The Clearing. His songs run the gamut of human experience and have been compared to the likes of James Taylor and Cat Stevens. One listener was heard to say " So beautiful I can't think!" With a percussive guitar sound and a sweet voice, Scott Maskiell is sure to tweak your heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jon Raven&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Crystal Thomas&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My name is Crystal. I just turned 21 and I breathe chocolate and music.&lt;br /&gt;---&lt;br /&gt;Born in Redlands, California, Crystal Thomas grew up in a musical family and began composing her own songs at the tender age of two. Crystal began seriously developing her own material in 1997.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By 1999, at age 15, Crystal recorded four impressive compositions that led to the involvement of Grammy award-winning songwriter Randy Thomas, as producer and collaborator. These early recordings caught the attention of writer/ producer Steve Diamond and former RCA representative, Teri Muntz, who began grooming Crystal for the pop world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 2002, Crystal moved to Turkey, where she helped develop a curriculum for 5th grade Iraqi children. During her time abroad she was acquainted with the Turkish artisan community, which influenced her both artistically and spiritually. After returning to the states Crystal co-wrote the script and music for the musical, "Evermore: the life of Edgar Allan Poe," which the Frankin Classical Players performed. After meeting with major labels in 2004, Crystal realized she didn't belong with a big label and she, Steve, Teri, and Randy parted ways. Crystal recently returned to Nashville to pursue the music of her heart, while supporting herself as a chocolatier at the Cocoa Tree in Franklin, Tennessee. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crystal’s brand of artistic pop has been received as a musical breath of fresh air. With influences that include Sheryl Crow, Joni Mitchell, Patti Griffin, and Rickie Lee Jones, Crystal’s style defies easy categorization. At 21 years of age, her musical style is surprisingly mature, with lyrics that are simultaneously vulnerable and incisive. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Poised to release her solo debut in 2006, under her label, Merope’s Star Records, Crystal Thomas is an intelligent and soaring musical voice, who explores the complexities of life, love, and the culture in which we live. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.myspace.com/crystalthomas"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.myspace.com/crystalthomas"&gt;http://www.myspace.com/crystalthomas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Seth Harper&lt;/b&gt; is basically new to the Nashville music scene. Sprouting from deep Alabama roots, Seth looks to further a sort of Renaissance for his homeland, keeping his music wide-ranging but at the same time distinctly Southern in delivery. His voice is gritty, yet pleasant, and his songs are honest, yet oddly poetic. He tends to weave tales of weary souls, beautiful women, and second chances, all the while putting on an explicitly spiritual edge. He is still looking for just the right bandmates, but until then he will walk this road all by himself.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2006/11/02/the-second-album-part-2-digression/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2006/11/02/the-second-album-part-2-digression/</link><pubDate>Thu Nov 02 00:17:00 CST 2006</pubDate><title>The Second Album, Part 2: Digression</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>Our recording session for Friday got cancelled.

First, as we were pulling out of Nashville, we stopped at a Taco Bell for lunch and met an extremely outgoing guy named C.J. at the counter. He can only be described as “jolly” – he was the Santa Claus of Taco Bell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When we got there we decided to go see Saturday night’s concerts (we performed on Sunday so we didn’t get passes for the day before). As we were waiting for Doretta, our manager, to get cash from the ATM to buy the passes, 2 separate people walked up and handed us over a hundred dollars worth of tickets. So basically everybody in our&lt;br /&gt;party got in for free. There were a couple of other instances, as well, but we all noticed how out of the ordinary it was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It ended up that it was a good thing we didn’t pay for tickets, because a huge thunderstorm rolled in and most of the concerts got cancelled, but I felt kind of sorry for everyone that did pay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On Sunday, we were scheduled to play on the Corr Wireless Stage at 2:30 p.m., so we got up early and headed back out to the park at around 12:30 p.m. We pulled into 2 band entrances before finding the right one. I think we were feeling kind of small with our little minivan next to the huge tour busses all over the place, for artists&lt;br /&gt;like Bo Bice, Sister Hazel, John Anderson, Tracy Lawrence, etc. But we loaded out our gear and waited while KC &amp;amp; The Sunshine Band did their sound check, and then took the stage for ours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, KC’s sound guy was annoying and made them run over on time, so we ended up starting our sound check late. All the stage sound guys were tired of him, too. There were some technical sound problems from the outset as well, including wireless gear with interference, cables not working, and sound guys forgetting to turn on the right channels. But eventually we were able to get everything worked out and got set up to do our show.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We played a short 30 minute set with songs like Fine, Misled, Solid, Clouds, and Unfaithful. We had so many technical problems stressing us out at the beginning, it was really hard to stay calm and loose, so it always leaves me wondering about a show like this one afterwards. But the crowd seemed into it, and we even had security&lt;br /&gt;guards and EMT volunteers from backstage complimenting us on the show afterward in the musician’s lounge area. So I think it must have turned out well despite the confusion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We hung around the festival afterwards and thanks to our band privileges we got some good seats at a few of the other concerts that night as well. By the time we got home around midnight we were all completely exhausted and not quite feeling ready to start the new week early the next morning…&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2007/01/07/bertrand-russells-argument-against-christianity/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2007/01/07/bertrand-russells-argument-against-christianity/</link><pubDate>Sun Jan 07 02:27:00 CST 2007</pubDate><title>Bertrand Russell's Argument against Christianity</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>Kevin Beck posted a great analysis of Bertrand Russell's argument against Christianity.Bertrand Russell said that:1) Jesus said he would return in the first century.2) He didn't return in the first ce...</description><content:encoded>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Kevin Beck posted a great analysis of &lt;a href="http://transmillennial.blogspot.com/2007/01/bertrand-russells-assumptionsand-ours.html#links"&gt;Bertrand Russell's argument against Christianity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bertrand Russell said that:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Jesus said he would return in the first century.&lt;br /&gt;2) He didn't return in the first century.

But it seems to be fairly clear in the gospels that Jesus doesn't expect people to be able to accept his message easily. His statements about dividing family members, about the narrow and wide paths, about bringing "a sword", all contribute to that impression. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But just as clear is the indication that it's fairly easy for &lt;em&gt;some people&lt;/em&gt;. And those people who find it easy are the prostitutes, the sinners, the poor, the lepers. In contrast, the rich will find it almost impossible. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The difference is remarkable, offensive, and hard to process. But I think it makes sense, and I don't think it's a class issue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we think of religion as hard, we're likely to think of stringent moral guidelines. That's what most societies are built on, and it's the impetus for most religious communities. But Christianity is hard in almost exactly the opposite sense; Christianity requires that we abandon the things that make societies and religious communities tick. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consider "turn the other cheek" or "love your enemies". Anyone can tell you that those don't make very good principles for organizing society. In fact, if you talk about it too much, someone will likely tell you that those statements are good in context, but that they don't work for society as a whole. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm sure people told Jesus the same thing. He seems to have insisted on it anyway. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consider his instruction to call no one "teacher" or "rabbi". I'm sure people would have pointed out how communities need organization, that passing on the faith wouldn't be possible without systems for doing so. Consider when he stated that your food choices don't reflect your soul, but your word choices do. Consider when he told the Samaritan woman that people would worship "neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem". Consider when he stated that he would tear down the temple and rebuild it in three days. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nothing about Jesus' teaching is compatible with society-as-usual. Which is why it is almost impossible for people invested in society or religion to accept. And why it seems compelling to those who have nothing left to lose. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Christianity is hard because it's hard to swallow. It's a tough idea to accept, and I don't blame anyone for not accepting it. But when I hear people suggest that an idea is "too hard for the man in the pew", then I think they've missed the point. &lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2006/06/09/clouds/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2006/06/09/clouds/</link><pubDate>Fri Jun 09 15:29:00 CDT 2006</pubDate><title>clouds</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>Stream The SongRead The StoryClouds (w:m micah redding)A long time ago, a nation very far awayYoung men stood on a hillside, dreaming of another dayThey never knew what this would lead to, all these v...</description><content:encoded>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.reddingbrothers.com/sound/stream/clouds.m3u"&gt;Stream The Song&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://reddingbrothersblog.blogspot.com/2006/05/clouds-song.html"&gt;Read The Story&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Clouds (w:m micah redding)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A long time ago, a nation very far away&lt;br /&gt;Young men stood on a hillside, dreaming of another day&lt;br /&gt;They never knew what this would lead to, all these visions, all these things&lt;br /&gt;All they knew was that they'd never lose the power of the dream&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And now a thousand years later, and a million miles since&lt;br /&gt;You can still hear them coming, hear their voices in the wind, they're singing&lt;br /&gt;A million different cities where the people cried aloud&lt;br /&gt;You could hear the changes coming in the clouds&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;[It came in the clouds that day&lt;br /&gt;Blowing open heaven's gates&lt;br /&gt;Coming in on the winds of change&lt;br /&gt;The day it all came down&lt;br /&gt;That day was filled with clouds]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They saw a new heaven and earth, a new birth, new universe, born right here on the earth&lt;br /&gt;They knew that if this was to happen everything would have to change&lt;br /&gt;They'd bring the revolution and the day&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;[chorus]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The change they knew was coming never took them by surprise&lt;br /&gt;But lifted them unspoken with the winds into the skies&lt;br /&gt;And now you can hear their voices, all eternity they cry&lt;br /&gt;Immortal they're a beacon in the sky&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;[chorus]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/how-self-help-really-works/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/how-self-help-really-works/</link><pubDate>Wed Dec 14 18:37:19 CST 2016</pubDate><title>How Self-Help Really Works</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>At the beginning of last year, I inadvertently found myself listening to an interview with self-help guru Tony Robbins.

That interview made me curious, and pretty soon I had listened to several interviews, a 20-hour full-length audiobook, and a course or two that this particular person had created.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I rolled my eyes a lot. The ideas seemed jumbled and questionable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was also on my guard about being conned. The self-help industry, after all, makes its money by selling courses and personal appearances for hundreds or thousands of dollars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the more I listened to this stuff, the more I realized it was working for me. It actually was making me feel more productive, more positive, more determined. And then I realized that even if it was kind of a rip-off, the value of being more productive and determined might actually be worth it. Even if the effect was just coming from listening to an audiobook read in a certain voice or in a certain way, it might make sense to do that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I kept listening. And I came to two conclusions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There are some solid ideas underneath all the fluff.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They are being presented in a very mixed-up way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think this makes sense. For one thing, a lot of the value that a “guru” delivers is their particular personality and charisma. The longer they talk, the more you are drawn into the vision and feeling they have about the world. So if they were to short-circuit that by being too obvious about their point, you might not actually walk away feeling inspired and uplifted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also imagine that mixing up the ideas in this way has a sort of hypnotic effect, as your brain tries to follow all the different spiraling trails of thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it’s also possible that the gurus may not actually understand the ideas themselves. This wouldn’t be surprising — someone who finds themselves possessed with a powerful charisma and the ability to motivate people will naturally start talking about big ideas. Over time, the ideas that seem most effective will tend to float to the top, and the guru might end up talking about significant and transformative concepts without even having a theory of why they are significant, or understanding where they came from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most likely this gap in understanding is why we typically hear language in the self-help industry that sounds a lot like magic. &lt;em&gt;The Secret&lt;/em&gt; is only the most obvious example of this, but it’s widespread in more subtle forms, and seems to reflect a sense of confusion around why something actually works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you can conceive it, and believe it, you can achieve it”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;That confusion is dangerous, because it hides the pitfalls and costs someone will take on. By pumping a person up, and then sending them out into the world, the self-help process may lead someone to great success — or send them careening into a wall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s easy to see why this is an industry that can lead to incredibly positive experiences for some people, and also lead to a lot of shadiness and abuse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But I’m not just writing this to critique the self-help world. I want to talk about the core ideas that seem to actually work, and explore why they do. My suspicion is that all self-help boils down to these three things:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;1. The Absolute Limits&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are very much limited by our context, our environment, our resources. We aren’t omnipotent. Everything is not achievable. To start with, the laws of physics put absolute upper bounds on what is possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, you can’t spontaneously be on the other side of the galaxy in the next few minutes. The speed of light dictates that it would take you hundreds of thousands of years to get there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the laws of physics dictate that the only places you could get to in the next few minutes are inside the orbit of Saturn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which is to say, that within the next few minutes, you could have reached the Moon, the Sun, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, or the Asteroid belt. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As far as the laws of physics are concerned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, there are other limiting factors. We need fuel to leave the Earth. You can’t just jump from the Earth to the Moon, because the amount of calories contained in the mass of your body isn’t enough energy to reach escape velocity, even if it were all burned in one giant leap. You’d need some other fuel to get you off the ground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So the laws of physics limit us, but thermodynamics limit us even more. It takes fuel to do things, and it takes time to gather fuel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, we humans are good at gathering fuel. We’ve gathered enough fuel to send untold numbers of objects into space. We’ve gathered enough fuel to send thousands upon thousands of airplanes into the sky, year after year. We’ve gathered enough fuel to put millions of cars on the roads — and to build the roads they’re on. We’ve gathered enough fuel to build the pyramids, and skyscrapers, and undersea tunnels, and to move the mountains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everything that humans have already done is possible. We know that — that’s a given. But we also know that everything humans have done is just a small fraction of what humans &lt;em&gt;could have&lt;/em&gt; done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, we are nowhere near our absolute limits. In other words, almost anything we can think of is actually doable. In other words, the possibility space is unimaginable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The point is not to get hyped up on all the imaginative possibilities. The point is to realize that when we tell ourselves something is unattainable because of our &lt;em&gt;circumstances&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;resources&lt;/em&gt; — we’re fooling ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is it within the realm of possibility that I could be the President of the United States, or the CEO of Apple, Inc. next year?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Absolutely. If it happened, we wouldn’t say that the laws of physics had been violated. We would say that something improbable had happened, that the unlikely had occurred.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the bell curve of different events that might happen in the next year, me becoming President is pretty far out along the probability line. Nevertheless, it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; possible. It wouldn’t violate the speed of light. It wouldn’t violate the conservation of energy. It wouldn’t even take that much fuel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, just about everything that people dream of is something humans have &lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt; done, or have proven ourselves capable of doing. We know it’s possible. We know it’s not completely out of reach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I try to remind myself of this. Sometimes, when something seems unattainable, I ask myself:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Is it thermodynamically possible?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the answer is yes, then we know there is a way. It’s just a matter of finding the path. It’s just a matter of making the improbable &lt;em&gt;probable&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And fortunately, we have a tool that does that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;2. The Human Brain&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every one of us has a three pound supercomputer sitting inside our skulls. Its job is to out-think the environment around us. Its reason for existence is to make all kinds of crazy improbable things actually happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wouldn’t it be nice if all the delicious plants grew in one place, instead of spread throughout a forest?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wouldn’t it be nice if when we walked, there weren’t rocks and holes underneath our feet, but only smooth ground?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wouldn’t it be nice if the power of lightning was less of a natural disaster, and more a matter of simple convenience — only showing up when we needed it to help cook our food, or light our homes?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of these things were possibilities in the natural world — but possibilities so remote that we would never expect them to occur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The human brain, however, figured out ways to snatch at these extremely remote possibilities, and move them to center stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is what a brain is for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of this, although the brain is very definitely limited by the laws of physics, it is the most significant force in the universe. It is the factor that changes every other factor in an equation. No other force, whether gravity or magnetism or radiation, can create such dramatic and unpredictable changes in a physical system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As scientist David Deutsch points out, if we wanted to know the future of a supernova, the most important question we have to ask ourselves is whether there are any brains in the vicinity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think this is why self-help gurus say things like: “If you can conceive it, and believe it, you can achieve it”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s hyperbole — it’s not the literal truth. Nevertheless, it’s close to the truth. Brains can work wonders. Brains can do things nothing else can do. Brains can quite literally create things that didn’t exist anywhere else in the universe, and would never have existed otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now consider that 99% of the things humans dream of doing are things that have already been done — that have already been proven, demonstrated, and worked out strategically — and suddenly it becomes apparent that our brain can accomplish almost anything we imagine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s just a matter of putting it to use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;3. The Inner War&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which brings us to the real issue: our brains are full of internal conflict. We’re constantly at war with ourselves. We are overcome with fear, we can’t focus, we sabotage our own efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is because our minds are divided. Part of us wants one thing, part of us wants another. As Paul said: “&lt;a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+7:15&amp;version=NIV"&gt;I do not understand what I do. For what I want to do I do not do, but what I hate I do&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the nature of minds: they’re filled with different voices. And those voices are a good thing. Those voices help remind us to take care of all the different — sometimes conflicting — important things in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But unless those voices can learn to cooperate, nothing significant will happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;We really only need to do two things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Come up with new ideas.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Execute on ideas we already have.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we need to accomplish something that’s never been done before, we need a new idea. If we need to accomplish something that’s already been done, we need to follow a plan. Either way, we just need to point ourselves in the right direction, and get to work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But our minds are constant insurrectionists. They are always plotting mutiny of some sort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So how do we overcome this, establish a common cause, and make something happen?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think this is where self-help gurus tend to diverge. They all seem to have different strategies for whipping our minds into shape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But realize that this is what it all comes down to. There are no universal strategies for success other than this; there can’t be. Becoming a CEO is a lot different than becoming a scuba diver or a Nobel prize winner. They require different strategies, techniques, etc. But the one thing they all share is that they require the powerful application of the human mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think if we recognize this, it gives us a few clues. A few guidelines for constructing our own self-help plans, if you will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We can’t rely on beating ourselves up.&lt;/strong&gt; We can’t live by willpower alone. Trying to make things happen by sheer willpower is just letting one part of our minds launch an attack on another part of our minds. That’s sure to backfire, creating even more internal conflict. A conflicted mind is not a creative mind.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A happy mind &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a creative mind.&lt;/strong&gt; I don’t think this means that we need to pursue “happiness” as that’s sometimes conceived. I think this means that we need to fill ourselves with things like gratitude, joy, peace, etc. I think this is the nugget of truth behind a lot of mysticism.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The mind wants to be led, not forced.&lt;/strong&gt; Which probably means we need to be inspired by a vision. And actually, this is how consciousness works: we imagine something, bringing it “on-stage” in our minds, allowing it to captivate the attention of all our diverse voices. This is why a lot of people talk so much about things like visualizing, affirmations, etc. These are all ways of gently leading the mind in a particular direction.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All of this is in pursuit of focus, passion, love, etc.&lt;/strong&gt; These are ways of describing a mind in sync with itself, in pursuit of a common goal.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t underestimate the physical.&lt;/strong&gt; Listening to music has a powerful effect on your brain. So does exercise. So does improving health, in general.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of this is going to sound pretty woo-woo. That’s almost inevitable when we’re talking about the human mind, simply because we’re talking about something that we don’t have precise, clinical language for yet. So we &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to talk about things like passion, gratitude, focus, meaning — and those things can easily become keywords for things like &lt;em&gt;The Secret&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t let that obscure what we’re really talking about. Although there are physical limits, we’re nowhere near them. The main things holding us back are our ability to execute on our plans, and our ability to come up with new ideas. Both of these things are struggles within the human mind, and that means that any self-help plan worth its salt will ultimately be about the care and feeding of that human mind, preparing it to unleash its amazing force.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Summary&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The limits we have aren’t that restrictive.&lt;/strong&gt; They allow us incredible possibilities, including almost anything we might actually imagine.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The most powerful thing in the universe&lt;/strong&gt; is the supercomputer between our ears. We just need to turn it on.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If we can get our minds in order&lt;/strong&gt;, we can create the new ideas we need, and execute the strategies we already know.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some proven ways&lt;/strong&gt; to achieve this focus are through gratitude, vision, and exercise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

I've always understood that to refer to the spoken word of God, the same word that said "Let there be light", and spoke the worlds into existence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It just occurred to me that Jesus, in fact, never wrote. He only spoke out loud. Later on, people wrote down his words, but he himself never wrote. I wonder if that means anything. What is the significance of the fact that God and Jesus both speak, but never write? What is the significance of the fact that Jesus is called the Word, not the Letter?&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://micahredding.com/blog/2007/04/04/loud-sounds-bother-my-unborn-child-smoking-mom-says/</guid><link>http://micahredding.com/blog/2007/04/04/loud-sounds-bother-my-unborn-child-smoking-mom-says/</link><pubDate>Wed Apr 04 15:53:00 CDT 2007</pubDate><title>"Loud Sounds Bother My Unborn Child", Smoking Mom says</title><author>Micah Redding</author><description>In our society, people often want to blame their problems on things outside themselves.

In many ways, this list of fundamentals echoed earlier creeds and statements of doctrine and belief. And this list suffers from the same problem the creeds did: it has little to do with the bible. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, the bible talks about some of these things - but it talks about them as events within a broad scope of real textured human life. And within this scope, these events have a meaning and significance peculiar to their time and setting. When extracted from that setting, they lose their color and their significance, becoming checkmarks on a meaningless list. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any time we take ancient texts and dissect them for our own organizational or political purposes, we lose touch with the texts, with the human beings behind them, and with our own ultimate reality. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not that we shouldn't find applications and poetic symbolism. But if we want to maintain our connection with the texts, then our own applications and symbolism must remain secondary to those of the original authors and audience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So with fundamentalism. These fundamentals were extracted to serve the needs of a certain political-social group within American history. That very act cuts fundamentalists off from the bible they claim to love, and from the history of people who wrote it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what if we let the bible speak for itself on what it considers fundamental?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we are to engage with the Christian scriptures, we have to accept that they are a set of letters circling around a singularity of sorts - an event they saw as bringing the story of Israel to a climactic point. They are, above all, struggling with how to process this event, and how to rebuild their lives as a result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That event, of course, was the crucifixion of Jesus. But that event wouldn't be remarkable in itself, if it weren't for their conviction that Jesus, in his death, had somehow triumphed over the very forces that were bent on destroying him. They had seen his victory, and were traumatized by it. Like the soldier at the foot of the cross, they were astounded to find themselves yelling that Jesus had won.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How could it be that someone who was killed had achieved a victory over his killers? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The struggle to answer that question lies at the heart of the New Testament. But it is the admission of the question itself that lies at the heart of Christianity. Pilate never addressed the question, because Pilate never knew that he had been beaten. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So we arrive at the one declaration the New Testament considers essential, the one question whose answer determines whether or not one begins to engage the Christian scriptures at all. When looking at the cross, who is the winner? When Jesus took his last breath, who was victorious? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Did Pilate and the religious leaders win? Or did a smart-mouthed desert-running peasant trump the forces that have enthralled humanity for all of our existence? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first Christians had made their own judgment, and they expressed it this way: &lt;em&gt;Jesus is Lord&lt;/em&gt;. The peasant on the cross had defeated the kings on their thrones. The core dynamic of reality hadn't been cornered by the warlords and dictators, but by a poetic Jew who refused to compromise his identity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This conviction is the one fundamental of the Christian scriptures. Without it, one is simply not living in the same world they are. With it, everything else becomes relativized; every other fundamental becomes a secondary consideration. They were living in a world of theological minimalism: there was only this one thing, and it made all the difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many things to talk about, many questions to ask and answer. But none of them impinge on this central factor. In the end, the Christian scriptures are much more fundamental than even the most extreme fundamentalist. Instead of five items, the scriptures have just the raw intensity of the one.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
