It's what Descartes was trying to get around when he wrote "I think therefore I am", though that may in fact be the purest expression of solipsism ever.</p><p>The argument is simple. I know that I am aware and conscious. I have internal experiences, real feelings, emotions and desires and thoughts. But there is no way to tell if the people around me are experiencing the same things. They may <em>tell</em> me they are thinking and feeling, but I have no way to confirm that. They may be saying and doing all the things I expect people to say and do, but never actually be conscious, never actually feel or think anything at all. </p><p>Science illustrates this vividly. After all, we can dissect a person's brain, but we can't <em>see</em> consciousness, we can't determine whether there are actual thoughts or feelings there. No matter how far we unravel the circuitry of a person's brain, we'll never be able to discover if they actually <em>feel</em> anything.</p><p>The only way we can know consciousness is from the inside. And so we'll never know if anyone else has it. In the end, we might very well be alone.</p><p>Absurd.</p><p>This whole thought process comes from a mistaken distinction between <em>being</em> and <em>experience</em>. We assume that we can separate our experience of a person from the actual existence of that person. </p><p>To be fair, consciousness tends to support that illusion. After all, it erects a wall between us and the world, so that behind that wall, we may have thoughts and conversations with ourselves that no one else can see.</p><p>But this is a bit like being able to lift the hood of your own car, but being unable to lift the hood of anyone else's car. Just because you can't <em>see</em> anyone else's motor, doesn't mean they don't have one.</p><p>In fact, if you began to question whether or not all the cars around you had motors in them, we'd think you were crazy.</p><p>Of <em>course</em> all the cars have motors. We can tell there are motors because the cars are actually <em>moving</em>. We can see the exhaust, we can see them fueling up, we can watch the way they operate, and how fast they can go.</p><p>"But", you argue, "Maybe they just <em>seem</em> to have motors in them!"</p><p>Not possible. By definition, working cars have motors. The fact that they move means there is a motor. It might be a small motor, it might be an electric motor - but it's still a motor.</p><p>You might bring in an ultra-small car. "Look!" you say, "There's no room for a motor!"</p><p>It doesn't matter. I may not know where it is, or where it fits, but I know there's a motor. If it runs, it has a motor.</p><p>"Not this one!" you say. "This car doesn't have a motor! See, it just has this bucket of fuel, and that bucket drains into this little cup, and that cup periodically ignites and makes the whole thing move forward!"</p><p>That is a motor.</p><p>It may be a weird motor. You may be able to explain the whole process without ever using the word "motor". But it's a motor.</p><p>Now, admittedly, sometimes it's hard to tell if a car has a motor in it. A car might be moving so slowly, it's hard to tell if it's running at all. But if it <em>is</em> working, then it has a motor. </p><p>The same thing is true when it comes to human consciousness. If a human being <em>acts</em> like they are conscious, then they <em>are</em> conscious. I don't have to figure out where that consciousness comes from, how it works, or where it is "stored". I don't have to understand what's going on "behind the scenes". If it moves, it has a motor. If it communicates, it has consciousness. </p><p>This is exactly how we operate in normal life. None of us carry around a ghostbusters-like "consciousness detector", to pick out conscious beings from non-conscious beings. Instead, we simply <em>interact</em> - and in that interaction, we know that the being on the other end is like us.</p><p>There is no deep divide between experience and being. And so, we are not alone.</p><hr /><ul class="series-list"></ul><hr /><article class="comment"><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script>
