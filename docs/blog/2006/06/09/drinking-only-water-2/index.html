My thoughts were that I was tired of waking up exhausted and having to drink caffeine to get through the day, only to feel even worse afterwards. I figured that if I was waking up exhausted, I needed to focus on getting enough sleep the night before, and I suspected that if I drank enough water, I wouldn't need caffeine, and might feel even better. So Gabe pressured us to make a pact to drink only water.<br /><br />As a result, I inadvertently lost 15 pounds in three weeks.<br /><br />And all without counting calories, dieting, or ceasing from eating junk food at the local convenience store. And losing weight really wasn't on my immediate "to-do list" either.<br /><br />There are several things that have struck me since deciding to do this. One is that I had the habit of getting hungry, and then dealing with my hunger by drinking soda. Even eating a candy bar probably has less calories and more nutrition than soda. And when you drink something, it may make you full for a while, but you'll soon be just as hungry. Replacing meals with sugar-water is a bad idea.<br /><br />This is not a calorie issue either. I would often drink diet soda; it too is filling, but leaves you feeling even more hungry than regular soda. So it tends to cause over-eating.<br /><br />The other thing that struck me is how water tends to fix your ailments. I haven't really done much better on getting sleep; I've made a lot of trips lately where I'm getting in at 3:30am and getting up at 7:00am. But when I drink a lot of water, it makes me feel more alert than caffeinated soda does. And in general, it just seems like I've felt better.<br /><br />This wasn't the easiest decision for me to make. Just like Gabe, I tend to drink ALL the time. I have to drink or chew on something. And my ideal situation would be to not ever have to eat and just be able to drink smoothies all day.<br /><br />But there is something philosophical to be said about eating when you're hungry, drinking when you're thirsty, and not screwing that equation up.<br /><br />Water is THE drink.<br /><br />-micah</p><hr /><ul class="series-list"></ul><hr /><article class="comment"><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script>
